        <h4>Terms used in creating mockups of performance dashboards</h4>
        <p>The following is a list of terms that I have used in the past for the display of performance dashboards.  As our project progresses we will continue to create further detail to these terms.</p>
        <div class="terms">
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Bullet Bars</div>
                <div class="definition">A compact indicator type favoured by presentation designers that efficiently uses screen real estate.
                    <a href="http://broadcast.oreilly.com/2008/11/creating-bullet-bars-with-goog.html">See Example</a>

            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Cascading Style Sheet</div>
                <span class="abbreviation">CSS</span>
                <div class="definition">A W3C standard file format (usually .css) that defines many of the layout
                    characteristics of
                a web site including colors, fonts, typography, spacing and alignment.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Digital Dashboard</div>
                <div class="definition">A single-page summary of a set of metrics that is designed to communicate important
                    information clearly and accurately.  Digital dashboards have
                    two main functions, one is to display complex data summarized on a single page and the other
                    is to permit the user to drill down for further information.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Drill Down</div>
                <div class="definition">In the context of a web-based dashboard, this is the process of allowing
                a user to click on an area of the screen to investigate further details of the topic.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Item Lister</div>
                <div class="definition">This is a page that will be used to list a series of items, such as a list
                    of models for the user.  Traditionally a HTML table view is used with the first row containing the
                    definition of each column. The chief items to be consered with include the columns to be included, a
                    definition of how the user will drill down on each item in a row, the sort order of items, and 
                    the default maximum number of items be displayed.  The list of models will be call a model-lister page 
                    and the page that the users see when they drill down
                    is called an item viewer.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Item Viewer</div>
                <div class="definition">After a user select a specific row is another page will be show that will
                    focus on a high-level view of that item.  For a specific model this will be called a model-viewer.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Key Performance Indicator</div>
                <div class="abbreviation">KPI</div>
                <div class="definition">A measure of how well an organization is doing on an activity that is
                strategic to the organization.  Each KPI is often associated with a requirement and a technical specification
                for calculation of the KPI metric.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="term">
                <div class="term-name">Indicator Type</div>
                <div class="definition">Each KPI can be displayed within a specific graphical disply object.  When
                we are building dashboards, the highest level of display is called an indicator.  The list of indicator types
                is determined by software system, but typical indicator types include stoplights, bars and radial gauges.  Indicators are designed so that acceptable values do not draw attention to the user that is visually scanning a large number of indicators.  When out of acceptable range an indicator should draw the users attention and invite them to click on the indicator to drill down for further investigation.</div>

                <div class="term-name">Metric</div>
                <div class="definition">This is a single decimal number that is frequently used within a KPI.  The goal
                    is to have a background process that consistently calculates metrics over time and accross organizational
                    boundaries..</div>
