    <Description>Conditional message routing.</Description>
    <Question>How can you route a message through intermediate steps to perform validation,
testing or debugging functions?</Question>
    <Answer>Construct a Detour with a context-based router controlled via the Control Bus. In one state the router routes incoming messages through additional steps while in the other it routes messages directly to the destination channel.</Answer>
    <NoteText>The Detour uses a simple context-based router with two output channels. One output channel passes the unmodified message to the original destination. When instructed by the Control Bus, the Detour routes messages to a different channel. This channel sends the message to additional components that can inspect and/or modify the message. Ultimately, these components route the message to the same destination.</NoteText>
