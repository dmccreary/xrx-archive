	    had with my colleague from India this morning. What you refer to as "the
	    record here" is really only a transcript of the shorthand notes of the
	    proceedings in this court. That is itself only a part of the record. The
	    record comprises the documents as well as the transcript. So, when you read
	    evidence from a document, it appears twice in the record: it appears in the
	    document itself, and it appears in the transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.17"&gt;The Court may consider the whole of the evidence in a
	    document although only a part is read. If there is evidence in a document
	    which is not read &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06157.jpg" n="6,157" xml:id="pb.10"/&gt; by the prosecution but which is detrimental to the
	    defense, the Court may act on it. The defense must then be prepared to meet
	    anything in a document which is tendered in evidence although it is not read
	    into the transcript by the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.18"&gt;That may make matters clear to Mr. Smith, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.19"&gt;Yes, Mr. McKinney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.17"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    German disinterestedness in the Netherlands East Indies question. The papers
	    emphasize consistently that the German attitude is entirely different to the
	    declarations of England, France and Holland, who had given their assent to
	    the Japanese government's viewpoint on the protection of the status quo in
	    the Netherlands Indies. In contrast to this, German disinterestedness &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06162.jpg" n="6,162" xml:id="pb.15"/&gt; is considered
	    as a sort of carte blanche for Japan. Germany has thereby stated that she

	    Ministry declared confidentially that the Japanese Ambassador to Berlin had
	    received the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06163.jpg" n="6,163" xml:id="pb.16"/&gt;
	    
	    direction today to express congratulations to the Japanese government to the
	    Reich government to the German success and to point out at this opportunity
	    Japan's special interest in the future fate of French Indo-China. The
	    Ambassador is to reiterate Japan's thanks for the friendly German attitude
	    in the China conflict, and at the same time stress the fact that Japan
	    believes she has rendered Germany essential services in the European war by
	    tying down American forces in the Pacific Ocean. The Ambassador is
	    instructed to suggest that the German government make some friendly gesture
	    on the subject of Indo-China in appreciation of Japan's attitude. Asked what
	    such a gesture might be the confidant said the Foreign Ministry is thinking
	    of a German declaration according to which Japan would receive a free hand
	    in Indo-China. According to newspapers, the Japanese Ambassador had received
	    identical instructions.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.26"&gt;Since, as a result of the collapse of France, the pressure
	    of the activistic public opinion on the cabinet became increasingly
	    stronger, the Foreign Minister evidently decided on this step, in order to
	    save his policy and to keep the cabinet from the otherwise inevitable
	    collapse. There is no doubt about the existence of the danger that the
	    Foreign &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06164.jpg" n="6,164" xml:id="pb.17"/&gt;
	    Minister would make tactical use of possible German blanc authorization
	    concerning Indo-China in his attempt to bring about a compromise with
	    America. Characteristic for the basically unchanged attitude of the Foreign
	    Minister is the elsewhere reported fact, that he concluded friendly
	    agreement on (one group of letters garbled) . . . at the same day with
	    France and England in Tientsin. As viewed from Tokyo, a strengthening of the
	    Japanese position of power in East Asia through annexation of Indo-China
	    would, in itself, be doubtlessly in German interest. In this way the chances
	    for an early end of the China conflict would be increased on the one hand,
	    and on the other hand, the differences between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon
	    powers would be intensified to such an extent that the danger of an
	    agreement would be eliminated for a long time. If, therefore, a
	    consideration of the Japanese request should be intended, a formula would
	    have to be found which would fix Japan's course definitely along the German
	    lines. This could, first of all, be achieved if Japan would have to obligate
	    herself to the immediate occupation of Indo-China. In this connection, I was
	    confidentially told by army circles that there the idea of occupying the
	    strategically important Yun-ann railway &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06165.jpg" n="6,165" xml:id="pb.18"/&gt; is being propagated. If the government should
	    evade a correspondingly formulated offer for leaving Indochina to them, one
	    would have to calculate at least with a severe blow to their position in
	    case this were published and probably with replacement by a cabinet which
	    would be close to us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.33"&gt;Signed, German Ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.29"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. BROOKS: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.34"&gt;Mr. President, I would like to point out to the Tribunal
	    that in the opening statement here there was a reference to the Minister of
	    Overseas Affairs, General KOISO, as Minister of Overseas Affairs, in
	    relation to this Indo-China matter; and I think it must have been an error.
	    Either it must have been an error in reference to this matter, which is
	    apparent from this paper -- it talks of the Foreign Ministry -- because the
	    duties, as I have inquired into, of Minister of Overseas Affairs have
	    nothing to do with matters of this nature. I thought it would be wise to
	    call it to the Court's attention. The prosecution might be able to explain
	    it later, or it may be that there was an error regarding what the duties of
	    Minister of Overseas Affairs was by the German Ambassador also. I am not
	    sure. We will try to clear this up further, but it has been troubling me;
	    and, since I saw this reference here in this matter to the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06166.jpg" n="6,166" xml:id="pb.19"/&gt; Foreign
	    Ministry I thought possibly that was the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.30"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.35"&gt;Mr. McKinney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.31"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    FROM TOKYO RE: INDO-CHINA&lt;/hi&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.27"&gt;Japan's thanks for the friendly German attitude in the China
	    conflict have come pretty late; the sacrifices which we in fact made for
	    Japan (stoppage of sending war supplies to China and consequently sacrifice
	    of supply of important Chinese raw material) have as yet received no
	    recognition from the Japanese, let alone economic compensation. Japan's
	    desire for a friendly gesture from Germany is somewhat strange in view of
	    the attitude Japan has taken re economic relations &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06167.jpg" n="6,167" xml:id="pb.20"/&gt; with Germany
	    during the war.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.28"&gt;If this is to be used in countering the Japanese Ambassador
	    in the forthcoming conversations, the following examples can be
	    introduced:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.29"&gt;(1) From the first, Japanese shipping has completely
	    subscribed to the French and English blockade.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.30"&gt;(2) For a long time the Japanese Government had not met
	    German wishes for transit of goods through Japan and had only in the dark
	    shown in recent months some obligingness. Thus an assignment of wolfram from
	    Canton and an assignment of tin from Columbia was sent on to Germany.
	    Recently, the Japanese Government even offered us 100 tons each of wolfram
	    and tin from its own stocks to be delivered without cost. However, there are
	    still unfilled requests -- e.g. increasing the Japanese shipping service to
	    Vladivostock which is only made the port of call three tines a month by one
	    Japanese steamer. Also, further shipment of tin from Columbia has not been
	    possible up till now because of the refusal of the Japanese shipping
	    company.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.31"&gt;(3) In January of this year, Japan concluded a monopoly
	    agreement with Manchuria for the supply of soya-beans without telling us
	    anything &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06168.jpg" n="6,168" xml:id="pb.21"/&gt;
	    
	    although we had been the biggest customers up till then, e.g. 800,000 tons
	    in 1938. After our remonstration, Japan has up till now only released 70,000
	    tons to be supplied to us from Manchuria.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.32"&gt;(4) Japan still refuses to transport home in small groups
	    from America the crew of the Colombus, nearly 500 men, because she regards
	    them as combatants, following the English interpretation, although in the
	    American interpretation they are styled as shipwrecked survivors.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.33"&gt;(5) It is true that Japan sullied us all the whale oil from
	    the last haul of 75,000 tons. However, we know from confidential sources
	    that it first offered half of this to England, and only decided to supply it
	    to us, when it had received no satisfactory English offer.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.34"&gt;Hereby submitted to the State Secretary.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.35"&gt;Berlin, 20 June 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.36"&gt;/s/ WIEHL.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06169.jpg" n="6,169" xml:id="pb.22"/&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.35"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.41"&gt;Who is Wiehl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.36"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    that Japan's welfare depends not on the Western Powers, but that an approach
	    to Germany is of significance to Japan, broke through even in circles which
	    till then had been strangers to Germany. One &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06171.jpg" n="6,171" xml:id="pb.24"/&gt; indication for
	    this is SATO's wish to come to Germany now. I am glad that he thus takes the
	    opportunity to get to know the new Germany from close by and I am sure that
	    his visit will be further material in the process of winning over the
	    circles which up to now had no interest in Germany to the idea of an
	    approach to Germany. Today the building up of heavy industry is regarded as
	    the most important task in Japan. The light industry is ready for the
	    greater part; where this is not the case its further development is of no
	    considerable political importance and can be put aside. If, in the field of
	    development of heavy industry, a close cooperation between Japan and Germany
	    is possible, which I do not doubt, Japan will gain freedom of action towards
	    the United States. The question of raw material supplies from England and
	    America I do not regard as so dangerous. The raw material countries are
	    under export pressure, especially if England should now blockade Europe.
	    &lt;corr&gt;Therefore&lt;/corr&gt; we need not fear the boycott warnings. But if our
	    economic circles see Germany's great industrial development and realize that
	    Germany is not only not behind the United States, but has overtaken her in
	    many fields, they will, in view of the unfriendly attitude of the United
	    States, gladly switch over to Germany. The improvement of Japanese-Russian
	    relations is, as long as the present war lasts, &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06172.jpg" n="6,172" xml:id="pb.25"/&gt; a
	    pre-requisite for this switching. TOGO and I are feverishly working for it,
	    and it becomes more and more clear in Japan that the future of Japan lies in
	    the South, and that the enemy in the North must be made a friend. Certain
	    military circles are opposed to such a turn, but there too OSHIMA will have
	    acted for their enlightenment in the meantime.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.40"&gt;After the war the German-Italian, Russian, Japanese-Chinese
	    and American blocks will remain. It is important for Japan as well as for
	    Germany that close relations between Japan and Germany will then remain or
	    be established. I see the way to that in the first place in the economic
	    field mentioned before. Germany should consign to the Japanese block an
	    ample position in her post war economic program.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.41"&gt;Ambassadore SATO could be told, in case the conversation
	    with him is held on this or similar lines, that the contribution, which is
	    expected of Japan, is to show a more obliging attitude concerning Germany's
	    wants for raw materials in Japanese (oil sources) and overseas areas.
	    Especially the argument of the export pressure on the raw material countries
	    points against the reserve in transit questions which Japan showed until
	    now. Japan should not fear boycott warnings or bring
	    &lt;unclear&gt;forth&lt;/unclear&gt; this fear as an excuse in regard to allowing
	    transit businesses for Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06173.jpg" n="6,173" xml:id="pb.26"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.42"&gt;A promise of delivery for the expansion of Heavy industry
	    after the war would today when Japan believes in Germany's victory, very
	    probably lead to considerable giving-in in the bean (Manchukuo) and transit
	    questions.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.43"&gt;Berlin, 20 June 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.44"&gt;(Signed) KNOLL.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.49"&gt;We will show that Knoll was a member of the German Foreign

	    communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.43"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.51"&gt;Yes, sir. We will do that with Wiehl and Knoll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.44"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.52"&gt;Mr. McManus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.45"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McMANUS: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.53"&gt;Mr. President, I know that several weeks ago former
	    ambassador from Germany was present here in Tokyo, Mr. Ott. In fact, I
	    personally met him, I would like to ascertain at this time whether or not
	    the prosecution intends to call Mr. Ott as a witness. If not, I don't think
	    it should be en cumbant upon the defense to call him, seeing that these
	    documents signed by him are being introduced by the prosecution. I think we
	    should have an opportunity of cross-examining Mr. Ott concerning some of the
	    &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06174.jpg" n="6,174" xml:id="pb.27"/&gt; statements
	    made in these documents, so I, therefore, request the Court that if the
	    prosecution is not intending to call him as a witness, that the Court direct
	    that he be placed on the stand, if available, for such cross-examination
	    purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.46"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.54"&gt;Well, if the Court, after full consideration of the material
	    attributed to Ott, come to the conclusion he ought to be called for
	    cross-examination, they probably will direct that he be called, but I
	    haven't had an opportunity of consulting the Members about that, point, Mr.
	    McManus. But they will all have it well in mind now. This is evidence not
	    volunteered by Ott but documents taken from the Japanese Foreign Office, or
	    other Japanese sources, and that may make a difference. I should say the
	    German Foreign office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.55"&gt;Mr. McKinney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.47"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.56"&gt;I present prosecution document 4025C for introduction. It is
	    a telegram from the German Ambassadore in Toky and concerns Japanese
	    efforts, through the accused MUTO and KOISO, to obtain Germany's views
	    concerning military aggression in Indo-China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.48"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.57"&gt;Admitted on the usual terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.49"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;CLERK OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.58"&gt;Prosecution's document No. 4025C will be given &lt;ref target="exhibit-0523.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 523&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, the document above referred &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06175.jpg" n="6,175" xml:id="pb.28"/&gt; to was marked prosecution's &lt;ref target="exhibit-0523.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 523&lt;/ref&gt; and received in
	    evidence.)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.50"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.45"&gt;Telegram (Secret Cipher Process). To be kept in locked
	    file.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.46"&gt;Tokyo 24 June 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.47"&gt;Arrival 25 June 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.48"&gt;No. 614 of 24 June.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.49"&gt;I.) The head of the Central Division of the War Ministry,
	    General MUTO has informed the Military Attache that the Japanese Army would
	    welcome it, if Germany were prepared, if need be, to act as mediator in the
	    already extended conciliatory talks between Japan and Chiang Kai-shek, in
	    order to conclude the China conflict in a way acceptable to Japan. The
	    General declared further that Japan is very much interested in Indo-China
	    also for this reason. The Military Attache promised to forward this, and
	    broached the question of Russia's attitude to such a development. The
	    General replied that the Japanese Army considered conciliation with Russia
	    to be necessary. General MUTO's inquiry is to be taken as the official
	    proposal of the Army, according to Japanese custom.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.50"&gt;II.) The Minister of Overseas Affairs, General KOISO, asked
	    me in a conversation to which he had invited me, what Germany's attitude
	    would be to the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06176.jpg" n="6,176" xml:id="pb.29"/&gt; military activity of Japan in Indo-China and in parts of the Netherlands
	    Indies. I pointed to the well-known declaration of the Reich Government,
	    according to which Germany is not interested in the question of the
	    Netherlands Indies and added that we would probably raise no objections to
	    Japanese action in Indo-China, provided that Japan obliges herself to tie
	    down America in the Pacific area, perhaps by a promise to attack the
	    Philippines and Hawaii in the event of Americas entry into the war against
	    Germany. The Minister of Overseas Affairs replied that he would be pleased
	    to pursue this idea further. Regarding a possible Japanese Non-Aggression
	    Pact with Russia, the Minister thought that for this Russia would probably
	    ask for certain territorial concessions in a northwestern province of China
	    and Outer-Mongolia, which could be discussed. The Minister admitted that an
	    agreement with Russia and the realization of Japanese colonial wishes in
	    Indo-China and in the Netherlands Indies would not only gradually make Japan
	    economically independent of America, but would offer to the expected KONOYE
	    t Government a promising starting point for an agreement with Chiang
	    Kai-shek. I have the impression that the ambitious Minister of Overseas
	    Affairs wanted to qualify himself for the next cabinet by putting out these
	    feelers.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06177.jpg" n="6,177" xml:id="pb.30"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.51"&gt;III.) Also Ambassador SHIRATORI, who is ever more frequently
	    named as the coming Foreign Minister, advocated a Non-Aggression Pact with
	    Russia in an interview yesterday with the YOMIURI.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.52"&gt;IV.) Today's resignation of Prince KONOYE as President of
	    the Privy Council indicates continuing internal political developments with
	    the aim of formation of the new Government and a new unity party under
	    KONOYE. Since leading personalities of the KONOYE circle are obviously
	    trying to make contact with me, I ask for authorization to discuss with them
	    confidentially the ideas of MUTO and KOISO, in order to establish what power
	    is standing behind them and what possibilities result therefrom. My
	    impression up to now that the possibility of the formation of a Pacific bloc
	    of Japan, Chiang Kai-shek China and Russia in association with Germany,
	    which ties down America in the Pacific sphere and could cripple her freedom
	    of action vis-a-vis Europe is becoming prominent.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.59"&gt;(Signed) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.53"&gt;OTT.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.60"&gt;The Tribunal's attention is directed to the fact that the
	    Chief Interpreter of the German Foreign Office made a record of certain
	    conversations between German and Japanese representatives, which
	    conversations are contained in documents to be presented in evidence. Where
	    this is the situation, Dr. Paul O. Schmidt &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06178.jpg" n="6,178" xml:id="pb.31"/&gt; the Chief
	    Interpreter, has furnished an affidavit which is attached to the document
	    concerned and copies have been processed and served on the accused or their
	    counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06179.jpg" n="6,179" xml:id="pb.32"/&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.51"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.61"&gt;I now offer in evidence prosecution's document 1397, to
	    which is attached a Schmidt affidavit. The document is a memorandum of a
	    conversation with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, in which the Japanese
	    Ambassador SATO renewed Japanese efforts for closer Japanese-German
	    relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.52"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.62"&gt;Admitted on the usual terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.53"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;CLERK OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.63"&gt;Prosecution's document No. 1379 will receive &lt;ref target="exhibit-0524.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 524&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, the document above referred to was marked prosecution's &lt;ref target="exhibit-0524.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 524&lt;/ref&gt; and was received in
	    evidence.&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.54"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.54"&gt;MEMORANDUM On the conversation between the Foreign Minister
	    of the Reich and the Japanese Ambassador, SATA, in the presence of
	    Ambassador KURUSU and Consul General STAHMER, 8 July 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.55"&gt;After a word of thanks for the hospitality shown by the
	    German Government and congratulations on the victory of Germany over France,
	    Ambassador SATO declared that just as in Europe the new order would now be
	    brought about by Germany, Japan on her part had been exerting herself for
	    three years to establish a new order in the Far East and in the South Seas.
	    In these parallel efforts a very close &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06180.jpg" n="6,180" xml:id="pb.33"/&gt; cooperation between Germany and Japan seems
	    to have been in operation. For three years Japan had been holding the
	    attention of the English, the French, and the American Governments and
	    thereby in a certain sense rendered Germany's task in the establishment of
	    the new order in Europe easier. In this manner the Governments of both
	    countries could mutually support each other.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.56"&gt;As far as Soviet Russia was concerned, Japan was under the
	    existing circumstances obliged to seek to maintain good neighborly relations
	    with Russia, just as Germany was also obliged to maintain good relations
	    with Russia. In this respect also Japan and Germany could cooperate.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.57"&gt;About America, Ambassador SATO stated that Japan has drawn
	    the attention of that country to herself since the beginning of the Chinese
	    war and that she tied up the American fleet in the Pacific Ocean. It is
	    Japan's opinion that America must not overstep her zone consisting of North
	    and South America and must not intervene in European or Far Eastern matters.
	    The pursuit of this principle is also in the mutual interest of both
	    countries. Ambassador SATO closed his remarks by stressing anew the common
	    interests of Germany and Japan and the necessity of &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06181.jpg" n="6,181" xml:id="pb.34"/&gt; their
	    cooperation. This cooperation must also encompass economic matters.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.58"&gt;In regard to China, Ambassador SATO added that Japan is at
	    present putting forth strong endeavors to finish the Chinese war, which has
	    lasted now for three years, in order to gain free hands. In this connection
	    he pointed out that public opinion in Japan has "become extraordinarily
	    nervous in respect to Indo-China and the Dutch East Indies.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.59"&gt;The REICH FOREIGN MINISTER noted with satisfaction Japan's
	    wish to cooperate with Germany in all fields. He believed that
	    German-Japanese cooperation in itself represented nothing new. He himself
	    had been one of those who years ago had furthered this cooperation with
	    KURUSU's predecessor, General OSHIMA, and it had already borne fruit for
	    both parties. Germany had made noteworthy use of it in her right for equal
	    rights, whilst Japan had doubtless drawn considerable advantages throughout
	    the whole period of her struggle for China down to the present day from the
	    existence of a strong Germany. Without the existence of a re-strengthened
	    Germany, Japan could not have been able to penetrate as deeply into English
	    and other spheres of interest in East Asia as it has actually happened. The
	    &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06182.jpg" n="6,182" xml:id="pb.35"/&gt; natural
	    interest of both powers in cooperation arises from these facts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.60"&gt;Plans for a very close cooperation between Japan, Germany
	    and Italy had already been taken into consideration some time before. They
	    miscarried because - as appeared again from the latest speeches of Japanese
	    statesmen - Japan was not interested in European concerns.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.61"&gt;As a result of Germany's Victory over France, a great
	    revision in all factors of foreign policy would follow. He personally
	    believed that in the future, further possibilities for friendly cooperation
	    with Japan would exist in the framework of the New Order in Europe now
	    taking shape. At the present moment he would say nothing of the details of
	    the form which this cooperation was to take, as he was acquainted with the
	    German intentions but not with Japan's political aims. He therefore asked
	    SATO for a further explanation of the principles of the political line which
	    Japan proposed to pursue. He would be especially interested to hear from the
	    Japanese side what was their thought of cooperation with Germany, whether
	    only in the economic sphere or in which other way.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.62"&gt;Ambassador SATO replied that it was &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06183.jpg" n="6,183" xml:id="pb.36"/&gt; comprehensible
	    that for outsiders the Japanese Policy had been difficult to understand. For
	    nine years, that is, since the outbreak of the Manchurian conflict, Japan
	    had been trying to orient her policy in a set direction, but had time and
	    again subsequently been forced to moderate this new orientation somewhat. In
	    regard to the new order in the Far East, for Japan it is above all a
	    question of permitting a new China to arise with which it could have
	    friendly relations. The solidarity between this new China and Japan would
	    guarantee peace in the Far East. In order to achieve this aim, Japan had for
	    several years been fighting obstinately against the so-called regime from
	    Washington which finds expression, in the treaties of 1921, especially in
	    the Nine Power Pact. This Washington regime did not give China and Japan but
	    the Anglo-Saxons the predominance in the Far East. Japan did not, however,
	    by any means wish to eliminate the foreigners from the Far East. Quite the
	    contrary. It also wishes to concede an appropriate place to economic
	    cooperation with Germany in China.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.63"&gt;In its relations with America Japan must of course be very
	    careful.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.64"&gt;To the question of the FOREIGN MINISTER OF THE REICE as to
	    what in reality then was the basic &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06184.jpg" n="6,184" xml:id="pb.37"/&gt; reason for the difficulties between Japan and
	    America, SATO answered that this cause lay in the struggle of Japan against
	    the system of the Nine Power Treaty. In this Japan was not fighting against
	    the fundamental principles of this treaty. Politically, it was quite
	    prepared to respect the independence of China. Economically it was likewise
	    in agreement with the so-called principle of the Open Door. It did, however,
	    wish to exchange roles and itself be the host while the other nations would
	    be only guests in East Asia."&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.65"&gt;Berlin, 9 July 1940. Signed SCHMIDT.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.55"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.64"&gt;I will now read the affidavit mentioned on the

	    Ambassador KURUSU, Berlin, Germany. From Foreign Minister ARITA.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.67"&gt;Matter concerning Japanese -German Concert No. 445 (Urgent,
	    Secret Code)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.68"&gt;Referring to your cablegram No. 870&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.69"&gt;(1) Your conversation with the Foreign Minister Ribbentrop
	    seems to have brought out clearly the spirit of German victory. You have
	    informed me that &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06187.jpg" n="6,187" xml:id="pb.40"/&gt; Ribbentrop showed you a 'non-commital' attitude concerning Dutch East
	    Indies and French Indo-China. Perhaps, he had no concern with these
	    problems. But did you not disconcern his air to persue something from Japan
	    by utilizing Japan - for example, Japan's participation in European war?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.70"&gt;You stated that he predicted the world would be divided into
	    four Economic Blocks in the future. But, did you not receive the impression
	    that Germany would not recognize the superiority of a certain stabilizing
	    power in each Block indirectly, but has begun to hope for domination by
	    Germany of the French and Dutch colonies in East Asia also?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.71"&gt;(2) While Ribbentrop expressed his optimistic opinion on the
	    subject of Japanese-American relation, you spoke of the tendency of
	    deterioration of Japanese-American relation and you hinted that, if war
	    should come to exist between the two countries it would cause Germany an
	    unfavorable reflection upon her European policy. Did you intend t o call his
	    attention by saying so, in the sense that the war with the U.S.A. would
	    inevitably cause Japan to march on to the South Seas and thus bring out
	    difficulties in accomplishing German object? Or, did you intend to warn him
	    that the war with U.S.A. would have an unfavorable effect &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06188.jpg" n="6,188" xml:id="pb.41"/&gt; on the German
	    war situation in Europe as a result of Japan's consumption of national
	    strength and weaken the pressure on the USSR? Furthermore, did you go so far
	    as to say in your conversation with Ribbentrop that the Japanese-American
	    War, if it occurred, would develop into a German-American war? Please reply
	    immediately.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06189.jpg" n="6,189" xml:id="pb.42"/&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.76"&gt;&lt;ref target="exhibit-0526.xml"&gt;Exhibit 526&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.72"&gt;Berlin, July 15, 1940. To Foreign Minister ARITA. From
	    Ambassador KURUSU. No. 901 (Secret Code). Referring to your telegram No.
	    445. Ambassador SATO answered.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.73"&gt;(1) It may not necessarily be that Germany does not embrace
	    at all a hidden intention to utilize as tactics her noncommittal attitude to
	    the Japan's demand in relation to Dutch Indies, etc., but, judging from the
	    RIBBENTROP's attitude, at least, I did not find such an air to request
	    Japan's participation in the war making a good use of it as a bait. I felt,
	    rather, that Germany did not attach importance to Japan's national power at
	    present, excepting her naval power. I cannot, also, say so far that Germany
	    has already fostered an ambition on the southern colonies. Comparing with
	    the days I sent telegram No. 527, today when Germany won the great victory
	    in European continent, it must not be passed over that pretty large change
	    arose in thought of Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.74"&gt;(2) What I said concerning the problem towards America was
	    not intended to restrain Germany's ambition on the South Seas, nor intended
	    to mean what was related to the consummation of the Japanese national power
	    and decrease of Japan's pressure on the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06190.jpg" n="6,190" xml:id="pb.43"/&gt; USSR. As seen in my telegram No. 870 and its
	    supplementary one, I made RIBBENTROP pay attention, suggesting the possible
	    development of the U, S.-Japanese war to the U. S.-German war. I talked him
	    those, a little in a threatening way, supposing the participation of the U.
	    S. in the war against Germany might be the great pain to her while she was
	    engaging in the operations to Britain devotedly and she was endeavoring to
	    avoid the long war. I guessed what he felt then was just this very weak
	    point. However, I avoided to utter such a direct narration as to say it
	    would develop to Japanese-American war, but used the expression as seen in
	    my telegram.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.67"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.77"&gt;You used the expression ". . . consummation of the Japanese
	    national power." Consumption is clearly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.68"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.78"&gt;Yes, sir, it is in the English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.69"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.79"&gt;What is right? Consumption or consummation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.70"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.80"&gt;The correct word is consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.71"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.81"&gt;Mr. Tavenner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.72"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.82"&gt;I now desire to introduce in evidence prosecution document
	    1308, for the purpose of showing the existence of a strong Japanese demand
	    for conclusion of a military alliance between Japan, Germany, &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06191.jpg" n="6,191" xml:id="pb.44"/&gt; and Italy as a
	    means of realizing the Japanese Empire's plan of expansion in East Asia and
	    the South Seas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.73"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.83"&gt;Admitted on the usual terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.74"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;CLERK OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.84"&gt;Prosecution's document No. 1308 will receive &lt;ref target="exhibit-0527.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 527&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, the document above referred to was marked prosecution's &lt;ref target="exhibit-0527.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 527&lt;/ref&gt;, and was received in
	    evidence.)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.75"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.85"&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.75"&gt;Minutes of the Joint Conference of War, Navy, and Foreign
	    Ministries on Strengthening of Harmony Between Japan, Germany and Italy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.76"&gt;12 July 1940. Those present: War Ministry, Lt. Col.
	    TAKAYAMA; Navy Ministry, Commander SHIBA; Naval General Staff, Captain ONO;
	    Foreign Ministry, Section Chief ANDO, Section Chief ISHIZAWA, Secretary
	    TOKUNAGA.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.76"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.77"&gt;ANDO:The Foreign Office gave instructions to Ambassador SATO
	    some time ago to confer with German authorities upon strengthening the
	    coalition between the two countries, and. Mr. SATO was able to exchange
	    views with Foreign Minister RIBBENTROP. At that conference, RIBBENTROP said
	    that he could not understand in the least what Japan was after. Therefore,
	    it is deemed necessary to draw and present to him a more concrete and
	    further penetrated draft and thereby intensify &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06192.jpg" n="6,192" xml:id="pb.45"/&gt; the coalition
	    between Japan and Germany. The draft distributed among you is only a
	    tentative plan made by our Foreign Office, but I want you to discuss it and
	    let me hear your opinions.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;q&gt;(Upon request of Lieutenant Colonel TAKAYAMA, he explains the substance of the
	    draft.)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.77"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.78"&gt;ANDO: This draft has been drawn with the aim of intensifying
	    the coalition of Japan and Germany upon supposition that Germany will
	    conquer England, have the hegemony of Europe and Africa, and establish New
	    Order there. Regarding our Soviet policy, which is an important problem to
	    us, we want to check Soviet through the influence of Japanese-German
	    coalition. There is a probability of the formation of a U. S.-Soviet
	    coalition, but we hope to check this likewise by Japanese-German coalition.
	    As to the limit of Japanese-German coalition, it is deemed wise for us to
	    avoid to participate in the European War, as is shown in the draft and in
	    view of our present domestic and economic conditions as well as our
	    relations with Soviet and the United States. (We have asked the opinions of
	    the Army and the Navy on this subject, and they both have expressed
	    approval.) Our plan is to join hands with Germany to the fullest extent but
	    within the scope of being driven into the war.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.79"&gt;TAKAYAMA:Is this plan merely to have the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06193.jpg" n="6,193" xml:id="pb.46"/&gt; three
	    ministries come to an agreement and to submit their opinions to the higher
	    authorities for discussion?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.78"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.86"&gt;We will recess now for fifteen minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, at 1045, a recess was taken until 1100, after which the
	    proceedings were resumed as follows:)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06194.jpg" n="6,194" xml:id="pb.47"/&gt;&lt;fw place="margin-left" rend="vertical"&gt;Greenberg &amp;amp; Barton&lt;/fw&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.79"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MARSHAL OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.87"&gt;The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now
	    resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.80"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.88"&gt;Mr. Tavenner,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;p xml:id="p.100"&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.81"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.80"&gt;ANDO:As this matter needs to be carried out promptly, I want
	    to submit it to the higher authorities and have them put into practice as
	    our national policy as soon as the three ministries arrive at an
	    agreement.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;q&gt;(The Army and the Navy gave consent to his proposal, and ANDO goes into
	    explanation of the substance.)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.82"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.81"&gt;ANDO: A plan has been proposed some time ago to the effect
	    that Japan should have Germany recognize its free hand concerning French
	    Indo-China, Dutch East Indies and other South Sea Islands. But as the
	    meaning of free hand is somewhat vague, if it is expressed more definitely,
	    it will be as drafted. I should like to hear your opinion on this point. The
	    object of this draft is to have Germany understand that Japan has no
	    territorial ambition over these spheres, but Japan wants to firmly establish
	    not only the freedom of economic activities but also political leadership.
	    In order to have this approved by Germany, it will be necessary to choose a
	    form easy for Germany &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06195.jpg" n="6,195" xml:id="pb.48"/&gt; to approve.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.82"&gt;TAKAYAMA:You say you want to make Germany recognize Japan's
	    political leadership in the South Seas, but, what relation does it have with
	    Japan's political leadership in China and Manchuria?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.83"&gt;ANDO: As I regard our political leadership in China and
	    Manchuria as a matter of course, I did not enumerate it here.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.84"&gt;ANDO: Concerning British, French and Dutch territories, we
	    will discuss the details later.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.85"&gt;ANDO: Concerning German support to the settlement of the
	    Chinese Incident, our attitude should be absolutely independent. For
	    instance, concerning such matters as German mediation of the Chinese
	    Incident which has recently almost come into question, we should have
	    Germany mediate from a point of view that as a part of the general problem
	    of Japan-German coalition, the quick settlement of the Incident and the
	    solidifying of Japan's position will become a favorable factor to Germany.
	    We should avoid assuming a supplicatory attitude. It is also necessary to
	    study concretely the recognition of the new regime and the prohibition of
	    exports to CHIANG.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.86"&gt;ANDO: The question of trade with Europe &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06196.jpg" n="6,196" xml:id="pb.49"/&gt; and Africa and
	    on other economic matters has been raised, because, if Germany should resort
	    to a closed economy in case of forming a block economy in Europe and Africa,
	    Japan would fall into difficulties. To meet this problem we hope to maintain
	    trade between the East Asia and South Seas economic sphere of Japan and the
	    new economic sphere of Germany, and to make clear whether or not other
	    economic relations should exist, as well as the difference /of Japan and
	    Germany's position in the two spheres/.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.87"&gt;ANDO: The most important problem among Japan's promises to
	    Germany will be the restraint of British activities in East Asia as much as
	    possible in order to facilitate Germany's conquest of England (refer to
	    Article (2)), and on this point I should like to request the Army and the
	    Navy to study what practical measures exist. As far as I am concerned,
	    oppression of British political rights and interests in East Asia or a
	    secret assistance to the native independence movements in India and Burma,
	    in accordance with the changes in the situation, may serve as restraining
	    measures.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.88"&gt;ANDO: Point 3 specifies compensation for Germany's
	    recognition of our political predominance in the South Sea Islands. Germany
	    craves for Wolfram &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06197.jpg" n="6,197" xml:id="pb.50"/&gt; rubber, and tin from China and the South Seas, and we
	    will supply Germany with them. We will also give favorable consideration to
	    Germany's economic activities (including investment and enterprises) in
	    China and the South Seas. (a) and (b) will keep an even balance.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.89"&gt;ONO: After the conclusion of the war there may be occasions
	    when Germany might carry out active economic operations towards the Dutch
	    East Indies, French Indo-China, and China, and especially after Germany
	    makes France and the Netherlands somewhat like subject states, it is
	    probable that she will dispatch active members of the Nazi Party to French
	    Indo-China and the Dutch Fast Indies and keep these two colonies under her
	    political leadership even if she would not go so far as to make them her own
	    territories. Therefore, Japan's policy toward French Indo-China and the
	    Dutch East Indies must be hastened in order to prevent such movement /on the
	    part of Germany/ and she must also endeavour to sever French Indo-China and
	    the Dutch East Indies from European influence as soon as possible.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.90"&gt;ANDO: As to our Soviet policy referred to in (2), it is
	    equally favorable to both Japan and Germany to maintain peace with the
	    Soviet Union &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06198.jpg" n="6,198" xml:id="pb.51"/&gt;
	    
	    at present. However, we cannot forecast to what direction Germany will turn
	    its relations with Soviet after cessation of the European War. It will he
	    necessary for us to make some sort of arrangement with Germany beforehand as
	    Japan and Germany will he in the same position in their relations with
	    Soviet. However, the relation between Germany and Soviet at the present
	    moment is delicate, and there probably may be something which Germany cannot
	    tell us unreservedly. For this reason, the latter part of article (2) may be
	    dropped according to circumstances.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.91"&gt;TAKAYAMA: Germany would not like to see Soviet penetrate
	    into Rumania. Should Germany request us to check Soviet in the East, what
	    measures could be considered?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.92"&gt;Concerning the above measures, discussions followed. Then,
	    the subject was turned to Japan's U.S. policy, Article (3) of Chapter
	    II.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.83"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.93"&gt;TAKAYAMA: Does this mean that Japan will not try to reach
	    any particular understanding with the United States after all? For example,
	    if such an agreement as to guarantee the peace of the Pacific should be
	    reached, and if the United States should, as a consequence, no longer sense
	    menace in the Pacific, it may interfere with European affairs, which &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06199.jpg" n="6,199" xml:id="pb.52"/&gt; Germany will
	    no doubt detest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.94"&gt;ANDO: No! Even if such an agreement should be reached, the
	    agreement will be made in a manner that the United States will confine
	    itself to the American continents and it will not interfere with the affairs
	    of the South Seas and other parts of the world. Recently, Hitler propounded
	    that the United States should mind its own business of the American
	    continents and should not interfere with the affairs of other continents,
	    and RIBBENTROP, in his conversation with our Ambassador SATO, did not seem
	    to hope for the impairment of Japanese-American relation to restrain the
	    United States, Apparently, Germany's wish is to maintain a peaceful relation
	    with the United States at present and in the future, as long as the latter
	    does not take an offensive attitude. Consequently, Germany is not likely to
	    hope for the impairment of Japanese-American relation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.95"&gt;TAKAYAMA: Will not Germany demand us to take some measures
	    in order to prevent the United States from participating in the war on
	    Britain's side?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06200.jpg" n="6,200" xml:id="pb.53"/&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.84"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.96"&gt;ANDO:Such anxiety was felt in the early stage of the present
	    War, but we have practically no such uneasiness now, for Germany does not
	    anticipate the United States' participation in the war any longer.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.97"&gt;ISHIZAWA:There is one thing that we should keep in our mind
	    in respect of our relation with the United States. After two to throe years
	    from now, the U.S. Navy will become a far greater power. Japan and Germany
	    must necessarily check it together.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.98"&gt;ANDO:Both Japan and Germany should not positively be
	    antagonistic to the United States, but should restrain it peaceably.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.99"&gt;ISHIZAWA:Judging from each assertion made by Japan and the
	    United States, there is a considerable difference in opinions between the
	    two, and it will require unusual efforts to adjust it. On the other hand,
	    upon the establishment of the New Order in Europe, the United States will
	    find it difficult to interfere in European affairs, and as a consequence, it
	    will intervene in Far Eastern affairs, with the Philippines and Hawaii as
	    its naval bases. Should a peaceful order be established between Japan and
	    the United States, &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06201.jpg" n="6,201" xml:id="pb.54"/&gt; the latter may insist upon pretty severe conditions to
	    be accepted by Japan. And if we try to make Germany restrain the United
	    States, we may turn out to be a liability to Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.100"&gt;ANDO: However, should the United States put pressure upon
	    Japan, Japan's power of restraining Soviet may be weakened, and Germany
	    would not like it. So Japan's relations with the United States and Soviet
	    and that of Germany will eventually become the same.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.101"&gt;TAKAYAMA: Germany has considerably advanced into South
	    America since pre-war time, and won't it be as absolutely necessary for
	    Germany to advance to South America after the war as well? If so, the United
	    States would not approve of this movement and don't you think a conflict
	    will arise between Germany and the United States?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.89"&gt;Discussions followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.85"&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.102"&gt;SHIBA: According to Helfrich who recently visited Japan, it
	    was said that, contrary to Japan's erroneous assumption, German's industrial
	    power which had expanded during and before the war would undertake great
	    economic activities in order to extend the market for German industrial
	    products in post-war time. It is certain that &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06202.jpg" n="6,202" xml:id="pb.55"/&gt; Germany will
	    penetrate economically into China and the South Seas also.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.103"&gt;ANDO: Concerning article (4) of Chapter II, as it was
	    decided, we cannot accept a request to join the war, even if Germany should
	    make such a request to us.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.104"&gt;ANDO: Concerning Chapter III, which is the coalition
	    between Japan and Italy, Italy has hitherto reiterated that it would support
	    Japan in her East Asiatic policy. It would be also important that we
	    maintain a friendly relation with Italy to restrain Germany which would
	    pride itself upon its victory. I think it will be an adequate measure to
	    present our coalition proposal to Italy at the same time we do to
	    Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.105"&gt;The Army and Navy approved his suggestion.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.106"&gt;Then someone asked, One of the most important matters for

	    note, unless the other government is anxious to have it written in the form
	    of a regular pact, as it would take a long time to enter into a formal pact,
	    anyhow. (However, in a case as 'the recognition of Japan's position in
	    French Indo-China and Dutch East Indies.' it was resolved that the formality
	    of an agreement may be issued.) To sum up, they agreed to carry out the
	    matter quickly. Furthermore, it was unanimously approved that the detail of

	    Navy to give us their opinions concerning the plan (proposal) relating to
	    the intensification of coalition among Japan, Germany and Italy which I gave
	    you on the occasion of the previous conference. Please start with Army.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.161"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry):I agree upon this plan as a whole
	    and will give you our opinion in details as to the meaning of the word NANYO
	    /T.N. South Seas/ contained in the phrase 'the construction &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06215.jpg" n="6,215" xml:id="pb.68"/&gt; of a new order
	    in the Far East including the South Seas,' mentioned in clause 1, I would
	    like to have it mean as Japan's intention to include the territory extending
	    from Burma and the eastern part of India on the west to Australia and New
	    Zealand on the east, but since there should be a South Seas of first sense
	    and also of the second sense, the South Seas to be expressed as Japan's
	    attitude for the present should be a narrower South Seas excluding
	    Australia, New Zealand and Burma. Nevertheless, I think we should consider
	    as Japan's attitude the NANYO of the wider sense.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.162"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): As Japan's ideal, Australia, New
	    Zealand and Burma, of course, should be included, but as a concrete question
	    we should adopt the South Seas of the first sense for the time being. In
	    regard to this point, I am wholly in agreement with Lt. Col. TAKAYAMA.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.163"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry):I agree to that.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.164"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, in regard to the outline of
	    clause (2), I wonder if it isn't necessary to discuss the point that is to
	    become the basis of the outline, that is the fundamental point, before the
	    outline is decided with Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.165"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): Since the fundamental &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06216.jpg" n="6,216" xml:id="pb.69"/&gt; point is that
	    since both countries are on a common footing -- that is, the establishment
	    of a new order in Europe and Africa by Germany as her sphere of livelihood
	    and the establishment of a new order in East Asia, including the South Seas,
	    by Japan as her' sphere of livelihood, does it mean that both countries
	    should recognize and respect each other's sphere and assist and cooperate in
	    the establishment of the new order within the respective sphere?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.166"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Yes.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.167"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Ministry): I have no objection to the opinion
	    of Lt, Colonel TAKAYAMA in regard to settling the fundamental point with
	    Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.168"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): That is, in regard to discussing
	    this matter with Germany, the outline and details should be entered into
	    only after the fundamental point has been discussed first.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.169"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Ministry):I agree with you. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.170"&gt;(Navy agrees)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.171"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, let us go into the contents
	    of the outline. In clause 1, there is a phrase 'not to interfere with the
	    self-government and independence of the various races,' but I believe it is
	    not necessary to make Germany express this.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.172"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): It is there for the purpose of
	    showing that Germany has no intention of &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06217.jpg" n="6,217" xml:id="pb.70"/&gt; acquiring these territories.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.173"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I don't think it is necessary to
	    make her say it distinctly. I wonder if it would not be sufficient if we
	    make her recognize the fact that French Indo-China and Dutch Indies are
	    within the sphere of livelihood of Japan and Japan's political leadership in
	    these areas. After all, it will be 'recognize the fact that the South Seas
	    area is within the sphere of livelihood of Japan.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.174"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Next, the question is about the
	    meaning of political leadership. The strongest meaning of this is
	    occupation, but we are not thinking of occupation at present. Anyway, it is
	    necessary that the whole country conspire and unite on the point of
	    political leadership and make Germany recognize as strong a political
	    leadership as possible.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.175"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): I think here lies one of the most
	    difficult points in regard to the question of intensification of this
	    problem. As seen hazily by the cable from Ambassador SATO, isn't it the
	    intention of Germany to grasp the political leadership for herself and give
	    Japan only the economic interest in regard to French Indo-China and
	    Netherlands East Indies, In other words, it appears &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06218.jpg" n="6,218" xml:id="pb.71"/&gt; as if Germany
	    will not recognize Japan's right of political leadership.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.176"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I feel that way myself, and it is
	    necessary to force Germany to recognize as strong a leadership as possible
	    of French Indo-China and the Dutch Indies.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.177"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): I think this point will be the first
	    thing argued when the talk on the question of intensification of this matter
	    is taken up, but according to the cable from Consul-General YAMAJI, the
	    other day, Germany reportedly is willing to offer Japan the eastern part of
	    the Dutch Indies, In another sense, it means that Germany is taking Java,
	    Sumatra, etc.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.178"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): As to what attitude Germany will
	    take towards Japan in future concerning the Dutch Indies and French
	    Indo-China depends largely upon the attitude she will take towards Soviet
	    Russia after the war. Since Germany has no intention to dispose of Russia
	    immediately after the war, she might leave French Indo-China and the Dutch
	    Indies to Japan easier than expected. But if she were to start with the
	    construction of a new order in Europe, the question of French Indo-China and
	    Dutch Indies will become considerably troublesome. &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06219.jpg" n="6,219" xml:id="pb.72"/&gt; And as for
	    Japan, she should, for the time being, consider that Germany has the
	    intention of politically taking over French Indo-China and the Dutch Indies
	    and should be prepared for it. For that, a considerably firm determination
	    is necessary.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.179"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): I agree with you. We should object
	    strongly to Germany's intention to assume political leadership in Dutch
	    Indies, etc.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.180"&gt;ISHIZAWA (Foreign Ministry): I agree completely.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.181"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office):I think the question of
	    French Indo-China and Dutch East Indies depends entirely upon naval power
	    and Germany, who has no naval power, will not be able to oppose Japan within
	    the sphere of Japanese naval influence no matter how stoutly she may resist.
	    Consequently, the question lies solely in Japan's determination.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.182"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): I think you are right, but Germany,
	    in such an event, might try to utilize Russia and check Japan from the
	    north. This, too, is a point to be taken into consideration.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.183"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office): I don't think that even
	    Soviet Russia would be a tool of Germany and carelessly meddle into this
	    with the hope of securing the northern section of Manchuria. &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06220.jpg" n="6,220" xml:id="pb.73"/&gt; Soviet Russia
	    would probably seek for the Near East and India.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.184"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): How about setting aside (B) 'to
	    assume a means of checking to expedite the surrender of England' as a
	    separate clause, together with foregoing clause 'to give appropriate support
	    for the disposition of the China incident This is because it is a current
	    problem or a matter to be concluded in a short period rather than one that
	    will regulate the future relation between Japan and Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.185"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): As this was considered as a
	    recompensation for Germany in return for recognition of the New Order in
	    East Asia including the South Seas and for her support in the disposition of
	    the Incident, there is no reason for any objection against making it a
	    separate clause.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.186"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): It is stated that a restraining
	    measure will be taken against England, but I wonder if there is any really
	    effective restraining measure?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.187"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): It's very difficult as a concrete
	    plan.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.188"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Then, is it not necessary to
	    change the working of this clause?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06221.jpg" n="6,221" xml:id="pb.74"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.189"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): The newspapers can be
	    utilized.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.190"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): The checking of England by Japan
	    and Germany's support for the disposition of the incident can be regarded as
	    balancing each other, and in regard to the recognition of the new regime to
	    be considered in connection with the disposition of the incident, the
	    balance can be obtained by the recognition of Poland and so forth, but in
	    regard to obtaining her cooperation in the economic construction of China, I
	    wonder if the check against England can't be regarded as its balance?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.191"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): As compensation for her cooperation
	    in the economic construction, the supplying of wolfram and other things,
	    which Germany wants, and her participation in the enterprise to some extent
	    can be considered.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.192"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I think we should refrain from
	    allowing her to participate in the enterprises in China as much as
	    possible.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.193"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office): In case of the worst, we
	    should show our generosity of allowing her to participate in as much as half
	    of the enterprises.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.194"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): We do that, I &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06222.jpg" n="6,222" xml:id="pb.75"/&gt; want that to
	    be restricted to the minimum.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.195"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): As for Germany's political support
	    in connection with the disposition of the incident, it probably is her peace
	    mediation for the time being. In regard to the economic problem, it is
	    cooperation in economy and technique, and as compensation, we can give
	    Germany's heavy industries markets in China and the South Seas.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.196"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): There is a necessity to consider
	    Italy together with Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.197"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Ministry):As compensation, Germany has been
	    conducting coastal trade since the outbreak of the incident, and I believe
	    it better to recognize such things as this coastal trade and industrial
	    technical assistance. I wonder if it isn't necessary for Japan to learn
	    economic technique from Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.198"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office):It's necessary. America's heavy
	    industry is rich in materials. In other words, it is a heavy industry of the
	    rich and Germany's is that of the poor. As for Japan, it is necessary for
	    her to learn Germany's poor man's heavy industry.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.199"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office):For Japan, it is extremely
	    important for her to develop the heavy &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06223.jpg" n="6,223" xml:id="pb.76"/&gt; industry in Manchuria. Consequently, if we
	    can't expect to take in anything from America, we must think of taking in
	    these from Germany. If Germany's technique flows into Soviet Russia after
	    the war, it will be a grave problem for Japan. We should consider
	    introducing Germany's technique into Manchuria and China after the war.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.200"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): Returning our discussion to the
	    beginning, does it mean, after all, that there is no concrete plan for
	    checking England?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.201"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): England can be checked to a
	    certain extent by utilizing the newspapers.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.202"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): The instigation of an independent
	    movement in India and Burma secretly according to the change of
	    international situation can be regarded as an effective check against
	    England.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.203"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office): I think it would be an
	    extremely effective check against England to take a strong attitude in
	    regards to problems against England in connection with the China incident;
	    for instance, taking a strong attitude in regard to problems pertaining to
	    Hongkong, Shanghai and Tientsen.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.204"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): Depending on the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06224.jpg" n="6,224" xml:id="pb.77"/&gt; occasion, it
	    may be a splendid idea to demand for the disarmament of Hongkong.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.205"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office)After all, it means firstly to exclude
	    the political rights and interest of England from China and secondly, to
	    instigate the independence of Burma and India.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.206"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): These should be executed to the
	    extent of not resorting to arms.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.207"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): As for the Navy, couldn't she make
	    use of vessels of unknown nationality?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.208"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): That could be done.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.209"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): Is there no measures to take a step
	    further and strike England rather than to check her?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.210"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): That can be done when Chiang
	    Kai-shek surrenders, but, for the time being, we had better not do it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.211"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): Doesn't it mean that we had better
	    participate in the war upon the disposition of the incident?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.212"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): For the time being, it is best to
	    proceed according to the present degree.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.213"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): If we discuss this &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06225.jpg" n="6,225" xml:id="pb.78"/&gt; question of
	    checking England with Germany, Germany might start ask us to occupy
	    Singapore.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.214"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): We can tell her that we will do
	    that when the incident is settled.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.215"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office):It would be all right if we
	    claim that the attack on Singapore is to be carried out on our own
	    accord.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.216"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): After all, it would be better to
	    negotiate with Germany with the attitude that Japan will have no
	    responsibility in regard to the question of taking part in the war, but may
	    engage in a war with England independently.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.106"&gt;There is omitted -- unless it has been put in in ink -- a
	    statement "all agreed" after the paragraph which I just read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.99"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.107"&gt;It appears in ink in our copies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.100"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading continued)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.217"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): As to the relations with Soviet
	    Russia mentioned in clause 2, it is to keep peace for the time being and
	    eventually to guide Soviet Russia in such a way as to conform to the common
	    standpoint of Japan and Germany. Depending on the occasion, the turning of
	    Soviet Russia's spearhead toward Burma and India can be considered.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06226.jpg" n="6,226" xml:id="pb.79"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.218"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry):Regarding our relations with
	    America, it is possible as a future problem that Japan and Germany may take
	    a joint action in South America against America and that whether Japan
	    should sustain Germany in her economical policy toward South America may
	    become a problem. Hence, I wonder if it wouldn't be better for Japan to
	    consider now the possibility of taking joint action with Germany against
	    America after the establishment of the new order in East Asia a few years
	    hence?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.219"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): In regard to the question of
	    America, there is a necessity of giving it greater consideration. Germany,
	    at present, is quite optimistic about America and concerning the post-war
	    administration, 'Schaht' is thinking of getting American loan, while other
	    Nazis are thinking of depending on the 'barter' system. After all, as to
	    what attitude Germany will take against America, we cannot tell until after
	    Germany has defeated England. At present, Germany's attitude is 'America
	    should not interfere in European problems.' From the Japanese-German
	    discussions, we can't tell anything more than what has been indicated in the
	    plan at present.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.220"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): That's right, but as for Japan's
	    mental attitude, it is necessary that &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06227.jpg" n="6,227" xml:id="pb.80"/&gt; she take into consideration those matters
	    heretofore discussed. In this respect, it is proper to have in mind
	    Japanese-German cooperation in the economic expansion into South
	    America.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.101"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.108"&gt;This is a convenient break. We will adjourn until half-past
	    one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, at 1200 a recess was taken.)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06228.jpg" n="6,228" xml:id="pb.81"/&gt;&lt;fw place="margin-left" rend="vertical"&gt;Goldberg &amp;amp; Spratt&lt;/fw&gt;&lt;p xml:id="p.121"&gt;AFTERNOON SESSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="p.122"&gt;The Tribunal met, pursuant to recess, at 1330.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.102"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MARSHAL OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.109"&gt;The International Military Tribunal for the Far East is now

TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading continued)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.221"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Office): I think Germany is looking down
	    upon American economy as a money economy in &lt;corr&gt;considering&lt;/corr&gt; her
	    future economic debouchment into South America. At any rate, it is necessary
	    at least to sound out what Germany is thinking of in regard to America and
	    Soviet Russia for the future. For Germany, America's support of Soviet
	    Russia is a great threat.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.222"&gt;TANEMURA (General Staff Office): From my opinion, a dispute
	    between Germany and America may materialize before long. There is the
	    possibility of a dispute being caused by America's defense against Germany's
	    debouchment into South America. As South America is a very good market for
	    Japan also, I think we should plan to undertake debouchment into South
	    America in cooperation with Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.223"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): After all, these matters are
	    contained in the policy restricting &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06229.jpg" n="6,229" xml:id="pb.82"/&gt; America to only within the American
	    continent. Although it is necessary to hold, as our mental attitude, the
	    points stated by Lt. Colonel TAKAYAMA, won't the original draft be about
	    enough for the time being as points to be written on paper?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.224"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry):As to the question of our
	    obligation to participate in the war stated in clause 4, Japan as already
	    discussed shall not be bound, but we should keep in mind that we might have
	    to wage war against England independently.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.225"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): In conclusion, I agree to the
	    original draft in regard to cooperation with Italy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.226"&gt;TAJIRI (Foreign Ministry): What about drawing up a simpler
	    plan separately with Italy?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.227"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): We had better to treat Italy in the
	    same way as and at the same time with Germany.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.228"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): As to Germany and Italy, we must
	    recognize that there is a difference between them of economic and political
	    power heretofore possessed in China.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.229"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): Regarding the question of Soviet
	    Russia, won't it be necessary &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06230.jpg" n="6,230" xml:id="pb.83"/&gt; to change our proposal to Italy?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.230"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): From the latest report of Mr.
	    Chuichi Ohashi, Italy is considering the use of Mohammedans to advance into
	    the Iran and Indian area. Should Soviet Russia advance into Iran, Italy
	    herself would have a considerable interest in regard to the question of
	    Soviet Russia, At any rate, Germany and Italy, though different in degrees,
	    are in a common position In regard to the question of Soviet Russia,
	    Therefore we could make a similar proposal to both Germany and Italy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.231"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): Nextly, I like to hear the opinion
	    of Navy side.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.232"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry):We agree to what Lt. Colonel
	    TAKAYAMA has already stated. In strengthening the cooperation between Japan
	    and Germany, we should make the recognition of the respective spheres of new
	    order and the cooperation between Japan and Germany the framework of the
	    plan and never to show that Japan wants things. Besides, in strengthening
	    our coalition, I wonder if it isn't necessary to push the discussion further
	    in regard to the American and Soviet Russian problems. There is no real
	    difference between Japan and America. &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06231.jpg" n="6,231" xml:id="pb.84"/&gt; Present oppositions between Japan and America
	    are most economical and for the most part emotional. Besides, in regard to
	    the Soviet relationship, it is necessary that Japan and Germany guide it
	    profitably. Only it is a question as to whether these points should be
	    exposed in the text of the treaty.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.233"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): The problem of America and Soviet
	    Russia should not be exposed, but should be dealt with in a secret
	    clause.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.234"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): What kind of steps are you going
	    to take to realize this original draft (plan)?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.235"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Office): Perhaps this will be discussed
	    between Japan and Germany and the main points exchanged through official
	    documents.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.236"&gt;ANTO (Foreign Ministry): Now the opinion among us officials
	    concerned has been unified. It is essential that no time be lost in its
	    execution.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.237"&gt;(All agreed.)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.238"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): I think I could settle with Army
	    along the line discussed heretofore.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.239"&gt;SHIBA (Naval Ministry): It's same with Navy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.240"&gt;TAKAYAMA (War Ministry): If the discussion is to be held in
	    Germany, it may be necessary to go &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06232.jpg" n="6,232" xml:id="pb.85"/&gt; and explain our intention, as it is
	    impossible to express it thoroughly by telegram,&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.241"&gt;(All agreed)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06233.jpg" n="6,233" xml:id="pb.86"/&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.105"&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.111"&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.112"&gt;Mr. McKinney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.106"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.242"&gt;Japan's ideal since the foundation of the Empire has been
	    that all nations should be enabled to find their proper places in the world.
	    Our foreign policy has also been based upon this ideal, for which we have
	    not hesitated at times even to fight by staking our national existence.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.243"&gt;What the entire mankind longs for is the firm establishment
	    of world peace. But it goes without saying that peace can never endure
	    unless it is a peace in which all nations enjoy their proper places.
	    Unfortunately, &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06234.jpg" n="6,234" xml:id="pb.87"/&gt;
	    
	    however, the establishment of world peace in this sense is difficult of
	    speedy realization at the present stage of human progress. In order to
	    realize such a great ideal, therefore, it seems to be a most natural step
	    that peoples who are closely related with each other geographically,
	    racially, culturally and economically should first form a sphere of their
	    own co-existence and co-prosperity and establish peace and order within that
	    sphere, and at the same time secure a relationship of common existence and
	    prosperity with other spheres. The cause of strifes mankind has hitherto
	    experienced lies generally in the failure to give due consideration to the
	    necessity of some such natural and constructive world order and to remedy
	    the irrationalities and injustices of old. The war in Europe brings home the
	    truth of this with special emphasis. Therefore, in order to establish
	    international peace on a permanent foundation every effort must be exerted
	    for the rectification of the blunders that have been committed in this
	    regard.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.244"&gt;It is in this spirit that Japan is now engaged in the task
	    of establishing a new order in East Asia. It is extremely regrettable,
	    therefore, that there should be those who not only fail to understand
	    Japan's great undertaking based upon this &lt;unclear&gt;fundamental&lt;/unclear&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06235.jpg" n="6,235" xml:id="pb.88"/&gt; principle, but
	    on the contrary, obstruct the establishment of peace in East Asia by
	    supporting the regime of Chiang Kai-shek. We have urged them to reconsider
	    such an attitude in the past, and now we intend further to urge their
	    serious reflection. We are determined to leave no stone unturned in order to
	    eradicate all activities for assisting Chiang Kai-shek.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.245"&gt;Sometimes there are those who would disapprove a change of
	    the &lt;hi rend="underlined"&gt;status quo&lt;/hi&gt; by force of arms regardless of the
	    reasons &lt;corr&gt;therefore&lt;/corr&gt;. It is for the purpose of bringing about a
	    just and permanent peace that Japan has been fighting in China for the past
	    three years. Her employment of armed force is an act looking beyond the
	    immediate present. The sword she has drawn is nothing other than a
	    'life-giving sword' that destroys evil and makes justice manifest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.246"&gt;The countries of East Asia and the regions of the South
	    Seas are geographically, historically, racially and economically very
	    closely related to each other. They are destined to cooperate and minister
	    to one another's needs for their common well-being and prosperity, and to
	    promote the peace and progress in their regions. The uniting of all these
	    regions under a single sphere on the basis of common existence and the
	    insuring thereby the stability of &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06236.jpg" n="6,236" xml:id="pb.89"/&gt; that sphere is, I think, a natural
	    conclusion.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.247"&gt;The idea to establish first a righteous peace in each of
	    the various regions and then establish collectively a just peace for the
	    whole world has long existed also in Europe and America. This system
	    presupposes the existence of a stabilizing force in each region, with which
	    as a center the peoples within that region are to secure their coexistence
	    and co-prosperity as well as the stability of their sphere. It also
	    presupposes that these groups will respect one another's individual
	    characteristic, political, cultural and economic, and they will cooperate
	    and fulfill one another's needs for their common good.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.248"&gt;When the present European war broke out, the Japanese
	    Government at once declared their policy of non-involvement and made it
	    clear that this country did not intend to intervene in Europe and at the
	    same time did not want to see the war spread into East Asia, Quite naturally
	    Japan expects that the Western Powers will do nothing that will exert any
	    undesirable influence upon the stability of East Asia.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.249"&gt;Japan, while she is carrying on vigorously her task of
	    constructing a new order in East Asia, is paying a serious attention to
	    developments in the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06237.jpg" n="6,237" xml:id="pb.90"/&gt; European war and to its repercussions in the various
	    quarters of East Asia, including the South Seas region. I desire to declare
	    that the destiny of these regions --any development therein, and any
	    disposal thereof-- is a matter for grave concern to Japan in view of her
	    mission and responsibility as the stabilizing force in East Asia.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06238.jpg" n="6,238" xml:id="pb.91"/&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.110"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    leading article in the, 'ASAHI' clearly inspired by the Press Chief of the
	    Foreign Ministry, the Foreign Minister intended to stress in his radio
	    speech that the present government has never deviated from the Axis policy,
	    and has always had full sympathy for the German demand for a New Order in
	    Europe, so much the &lt;unclear&gt;more&lt;/unclear&gt; since Japan herself is striving
	    for a New Order in Asia. The government is determined to consolidate Axis
	    friendship. The army protested against this attitude on the grounds that in
	    reality the above policy of sympathy for the Axis is not compatible with the
	    policies hitherto pursued by the cabinet and because the army wanted to
	    avoid the YONAI-ARITA cabinet using a sudden stress on friendship with the
	    Axis as a chess move to take the wind out of the sails of the opposition,
	    which is close to us and to save its own existence.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.263"&gt;The action of the Press Chief of the Foreign Ministry, who

	    circles.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.264"&gt;As I have learned confidentially, the Press Chief was

Telephone calls at 7:30 AM, from both the Director

	    sometime been planned by the MAEDA faction, arrests were begun from 5:30 AM
	    at several rendezvous places in the city. Their proposed objectives were
	    Premier YONAI, Mr. MACHIDA, Count MAKINO, Baron HARADA, Baron ICHIKI, Mr.
	    IKEDA, Admiral OKADA, Mr. YUASA and household Minister MATSUDAIRA. Besides
	    nine pistols, two hand grenades, thirty swords and thirty beer bottles of
	    benzine, many copies of a prospectus, stating why they were aroused to act,
	    were confiscated.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.270"&gt;Was received in audience at 11:40. I reported on the MAEDA
	    affair and answered various questions cut by the Throne. I also stated to
	    His Majesty that their actions were to blame but as to their motives, the
	    administrators must reflect seriously upon them. Withdrew from the Palace at
	    12:15.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.271"&gt;After that, exchanged frank opinions with Prince KONOYE in

	    Baron HIRANUMA to the effect that he thought that at this time when rumors
	    of a political change are rife there is no other person so suitable for
	    appointment as Prince KONOYE.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.276"&gt;8 July -- beginning with the second sentence, that is, the
	    middle of page 2:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.277"&gt;Vice-War Minister ANAMI called and expressed &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06243.jpg" n="6,243" xml:id="pb.96"/&gt; himself as
	    follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.278"&gt;Now when a political change may be unavoidable within the
	    next four or five days, and the military have been perfecting preparations
	    to meet the abrupt changes in the latest world situation, the character of
	    the YONAI cabinet is not at all suitable for making negotiations with
	    Germany and Italy and it might even cause a fatal delay. The conclusion is
	    that a cabinet change is inevitable in order to face this grave situation.
	    The army unanimously will support Prince KONOYE's candidacy. Upon meeting
	    Prince KONOYE after his return to Tokyo, the War Minister will take the
	    opportunity to submit an important proposal to Premier YONAI.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.279"&gt;Upon my mentioning that the selection of a Foreign Minister
	    would be most difficult, he replied that the Army would leave such a
	    question entirely to Prince KONOYE.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.125"&gt;Right at the top of the next page is the next section to be
	    read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.280"&gt;In the Army General Staff Office in recent days, the
	    officers forming the central core presented their opinions to the leading
	    staff members from the viewpoints of both political and military policies,
	    as they anticipate that the personnel of the present &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06244.jpg" n="6,244" xml:id="pb.97"/&gt; government
	    will never be able to sufficiently cope with the latest world situation. As
	    a result, it is understood that the Chief of the Army General Staff, Prince
	    KANIN, told the War Minister about the matter, and the War Minister has been
	    much concerned about what measures to take. Such being the case, the
	    expression of resolute determination by the War Minister may well depend
	    upon the behavior of the Cabinet itself. And so on . . . . &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.121"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. LOGAN: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.126"&gt;If the Tribunal please, I think the transcript should show
	    that the last paragraph which was read was a statement made by the Chief
	    Aide-de-Camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.122"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.127"&gt;It appears in the last sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.123"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.128"&gt;Yes, that is correct, on page 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.124"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.129"&gt;It appears in the last sentence on page 1 that the Chief
	    Aide-de-Camp made that statement -- the last sentence on page 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.125"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. McKINNEY: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.130"&gt;Next, July 16, the second sentence about the middle of page
	    3:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.281"&gt;Chief Cabinet Secretary ISHIWATA telephoned this morning as
	    follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.282"&gt;War Minister HATA met Premier YONAI after 9:00 A. M. this
	    morning and submitted his resignation. &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06245.jpg" n="6,245" xml:id="pb.98"/&gt; When told by the Premier to produce a
	    successor, he replied that an answer may be expected by evening and left. As
	    the Army cannot be expected to produce a successor, the Premier, after
	    calling an extraordinary Cabinet meeting today, will probably have to go to
	    the HAYAMA Imperial villa to submit a mass resignation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.283"&gt;Thereupon, I immediately requested the Grand Chamberlain,
	    Chief Aide-de-Camp and HIROHATA the Lord Steward to Her Majesty the Empress
	    to assemble in my room. I told them of the foregoing matter and we consulted
	    about the Emperor's return trip and other matters. We made a provisional
	    plan but decided to wait for the arrival of the Imperial Household Minister
	    from Tokyo before making the final decision.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.284"&gt;Upon the Emperor's return from the sea, was received in
	    audience at 12:10 and reported to the Throne about the above matters.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.285"&gt;Was again received in audience at 1:45, fully explained the
	    procedure of selecting the leader of the incoming cabinet, which had
	    previously been studied and decided upon and got his approval. The summary
	    is as follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06246.jpg" n="6,246" xml:id="pb.99"/&gt;&lt;fw place="margin-left" rend="vertical"&gt;Abram &amp;amp; Morse&lt;/fw&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.286"&gt;1. The Emperor requested the Lord Privy Seal to ask the
	    President of the Privy Council and the former premiers about the selection
	    of the head of the incoming cabinet and to report their answer after
	    consultation with the Elder Statesman.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.287"&gt;The Emperor will at the same time order the Grand
	    Chamberlain to make arrangements to assemble the said personages in the
	    Palace.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.288"&gt;2. The Lord Privy Seal will arrange the council of these
	    personages in the Palace and he himself will participate in it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.289"&gt;3. Further, the Lord Privy Seal himself will call on the
	    Elder Stateman or will have the Chief Secretary do so to consult about the
	    matter and report the result to the Throne.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.290"&gt;The following information has been received from the Chief
	    Aide-de-Camps He received a phone call from Vice-Minister ANAMI of the War
	    Ministry, according to whom the state of affairs leading to the Minister's
	    resignation, is as follows: Several days ago a memorandum containing the
	    army's opinion on the present situation was submitted to the Premier, who
	    summoned the War Minister this morning, and telling him that the army's idea
	    was different from that of the present cabinet, asked him &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06247.jpg" n="6,247" xml:id="pb.100"/&gt; bluntly to
	    resign in case of inconvenience. Thereupon the War Minister at once
	    submitted his resignation. As the Premier further asked him to recommend his
	    successor, the Three Chief Officers' Meeting was held from 2:30 P.M. but
	    because of the foregoing situation it was extremely difficult to make any
	    recommendation."&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.131"&gt;Now skipping one paragraph and continuing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.291"&gt;Premier YONAI came to Hayama from Tokyo at 6:40 P.M. and
	    explained the details of the resignation en bloc. It was about as I have set
	    it down. As a result of the conference of the three chiefs it was said that
	    although the selection of a successor was not being refused, it was
	    difficult to choose one and no forecast was possible.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.292"&gt;Premier YONAI in announcing to the Cabinet his decision in
	    favor of a resignation en bloc did not as was usual in the past call each
	    minister Separately to his room and talk to him. Instead he assembled all
	    the members in the cabinet meeting room and stating first that this was not
	    a cabinet meeting, expressed his decision. At this, War Minister HATA
	    scowled, but straightway stood up and made a speech. That is the story.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.293"&gt;At this time I communicated to the Premier &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06248.jpg" n="6,248" xml:id="pb.101"/&gt; His Majesty's
	    opinion which I had previously learned and the Premier was deeply moved.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.294"&gt;After supper the Premier was received in audience by the
	    Emperor and tendered the resignation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.295"&gt;I was received in audience at 7:40 P.M. and was requested
	    to choose a successor. To this I replied that in response to the order I
	    would request a council of the Senior Statesmen tomorrow in the Palace to
	    discuss the matter.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.296"&gt;In the course of my audience with the Emperor, the Emperor
	    told me the circumstances surrounding his summoning of War Minister HATA at
	    the time when the Imperial order for cabinet formation was given to Admiral
	    YONAI.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.297"&gt;The Emperor said that he had not shown him any special
	    favor, although there was a gross misunderstanding about the matter. He had
	    been told that KONOYE also was of the opinion that it would be well to
	    question HATA and that YUASA, too, thought that questioning would be all
	    right. He had called HATA and had asked him whether the Army was willing to
	    cooperate with YONAI, to whom he, the Emperor, had given the Imperial order.
	    As HATA had replied that the Army would cooperate, the Emperor had said that
	    that was fine and had not given any orders.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06249.jpg" n="6,249" xml:id="pb.102"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.298"&gt;17 July, Wednesday&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.132"&gt;-- next page, &lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.299"&gt;Mrs. Keiko SOMA called. After a short talk with her I went
	    to the office at 10. Before 1 o'clock, in response to the invitation
	    telegram from Grand Chamberlain MOMOTAKE, President HARA of the Privy
	    Council and six former Premiers, WAKATSUKI, OKADA, HIROTA, HAYASHI, KONOYE
	    and HIRANUMA, assembled in the West Ante-Chamber of the Palace, and from 1
	    o'clock a meeting was held in the West No. 2 Room to select the head of the
	    incoming cabinet following the presentation of resignation by Premier
	    YONAI.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.300"&gt;The meeting was opened with a speech by Assistant Grand
	    Chamberlain KANROJI, who acting in place of the Grand Chamberlain conveyed
	    His Majesty's opinions and thoughts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.301"&gt;Then I stated to them that I had been told by the Emperor
	    to consult the Elder Statesman about the matter to report the result to the
	    throne; that the meeting had been called today to enable a frank exchange of
	    views on the subject; that the meeting, because of the nature of the matter
	    to be discussed, could not be called a conference, and consequently the
	    decision would not be put to such a formality as voting, and that their
	    informal talk and free and frank exchange of views were requested so as not
	    to &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06250.jpg" n="6,250" xml:id="pb.103"/&gt; leave
	    anything undone regarding the selection of the succeeding premier.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.302"&gt;HARA--All I know about the reason for the resignation of
	    the YONAI Cabinet is from the newspapers. If you know the truth I would like
	    to hear about it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.303"&gt;Lord Privy Seal--I don't know the details but the gist of
	    what I learned of the situation from Premier YONAI yesterday at HAYAMA is as
	    follows: The Army thinks that the present cabinet is not adequate to carry
	    out a policy Which will suit the present ever-changing world situation and
	    which will not be regretted later. It seems to show also a tendency to favor
	    a political reapproachment with Germany and Italy. It also feels that even
	    in domestic affairs the government, being separated from the people, will be
	    unable to obtain satisfactory results in a number of policies, and that
	    unless the political structure is strengthened, the government will be
	    unable to cope with the present emergency. In a word since the War
	    Minister's opinion is different from that of the present cabinet, he cannot
	    fulfill his duty as the leader of the Army. Hence he has come to the point
	    of resigning.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.304"&gt;WAKATSUKI:I feel that there is no one fit &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06251.jpg" n="6,251" xml:id="pb.104"/&gt; for the
	    Premier's post at this time except Prince KONOYE. I hope Prince KONOYE will
	    take the field.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.305"&gt;HARA:It would be fine if Prince KONOYE took the field.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.306"&gt;HIRANUMA, HAYASHI, OKADA: We quite agree with Baron
	    WAKATSUKI's opinion.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.307"&gt;Prince KONOYE: In view of the circumstances leading to the
	    general resignation of the YONAI cabinet, the one to take charge of the
	    present situation should be well versed in military affairs with a full
	    understanding of them. As I do not have such ability, and have made no
	    preparations for it, I would like to see someone more fit for the post
	    selected.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.308"&gt;Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal:I have heard that the views
	    of the military leaders are overwhelmingly in favor of Prince KONOYE's
	    taking the field. Besides, there are points in the present actions of the
	    army which may be understood as having been based on the assumption that
	    Prince KONOYE would rise. I do not think that there is any other person fit
	    for the post. I earnestly hope that Prince KONOYE will come forward.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.309"&gt;HIRANUMA: It is a bad example that the cabinet should fall
	    on account of the War Minister's resignation, and it is regretabble that we
	    have often &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06252.jpg" n="6,252" xml:id="pb.105"/&gt;
	    
	    had such examples. It should be that a successor would be found and the
	    cabinet be able to continue. However, because in practice the custom has
	    come-about of having the three chiefs make the recommendation, such
	    situations as today's arise. It is reasonable that Prince KONOYE is
	    concerned over this point, and I feel sorry for him having to take the field
	    at this time. However, since we cannot find anyone else fit for the post,
	    there is nothing for it but to earnestly ask Prince KONOYE to come forward.
	    Moreover, since we are in this difficult position it is needless to say that
	    every quarter not to speak of ourselves should endeavor to make it easy for
	    the Prince to manage his task.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.310"&gt;HIROTA: It seems the China Incident cannot be easily
	    settled if the cabinet is as weak as it has been, and there is no other way
	    but to continue the present state of affairs. Judged from this view point,
	    it would also be a good thing to have a suitable military man capable of
	    working closely with the Army and Navy. However, there is no such man.
	    Besides, since the military themselves wish it there is no problem about
	    asking Prince KONOYE to take the field. Lately we have had all kinds of
	    rumors. The &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06253.jpg" n="6,253" xml:id="pb.106"/&gt;
	    Lord Privy Seal must have made quite an investigation of them.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.311"&gt;Lord Privy Seal: AS I have said before, according to the
	    information we have received, various rumors are prevailing, but generally
	    speaking, there is a strong hope that Prince KONOYE will take the field.
	    Also at this time when the enc of the China Incident is gradually
	    approaching, I feel that a large section of the public is of the opinion
	    that there is no suitable person other than Prince KONOYE to form a strong
	    cabinet.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.312"&gt;Lord Privy Seal: I can easily see that you generally agree
	    upon Prince KONOYE. After consulting the Elder Statesman, KIDO will report
	    the reply to the throne.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.313"&gt;Things took place as I have noted and the meeting was
	    closed at 1:30 p.m. I sent Chief Secretary MATSUKAIRA to OKITSU by the 3:00
	    p.m. train to see Prince SAIONJI. Their Majesties returned from HAYAMA at
	    5:10 p.m. At 6:36 Chief Secretary MATSUDAIRA telephoned me from Prince
	    SAIONJI's villa at OKITSU that as the old prince was not only sick at that
	    time but also knew little of the political situation, he could not take the
	    responsibility of replying to the throne. So I answered that I understood. I
	    was &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06254.jpg" n="6,254" xml:id="pb.107"/&gt; received
	    in audience by His Majesty at 7:00 p.m. I informed Him of the result of the
	    meeting and of Prince SAIONJI's reply. Although Prince SAIONJI's reply to
	    the throne was inevitable because of advanced age, His Majesty in order to
	    show his respect wishes to ask the Elder statesman hereafter also. However,
	    as I felt sorry to see the GENRO pressed for a reply, I asked the Emperor to
	    call Prince KONOYE leaving that matter as it was. His Majesty gladly
	    accepted my request. Accordingly the Emperor had the Grand Chamberlain
	    summon Prince KONOYE by telephone. Again I was received in audience by His
	    Majesty. I reported the details of this afternoon's meeting. At that time
	    the Emperor spoke as follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.314"&gt;'When War Minister HATA came to HAYAMA today to report to
	    the throne on personnel, he told me what the opinion of the army is.
	    Generally it was the same as that which KIDO had heard from HONAI yesterday.
	    I told him that this business was very regrettable, but I felt it was one
	    consolation that we could see where the responsibility lay, although there
	    had been up till now many uncertain attitudes. HATA, who was once Chief
	    Aide-de-Camp and who knows how busy I am at such times, was extremely sorry
	    and had tears in his eyes.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06255.jpg" n="6,255" xml:id="pb.108"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.315"&gt;I retired from the Imperial presence at 7:40 p.m. On that
	    occasion the Emperor asked me whether he might give KONOYE some advice, it
	    being of a simple matter, which KIDO also had once mentioned. That is, that
	    KONOYE should be prudent especially in the choice of Foreign and Finance
	    Ministers at this time when the situation at home and abroad is grave.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.316"&gt;Of course I replied that it would be a good idea to do
	    so.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.317"&gt;Prince KONOYE came to the Imperial Palace at eight. After
	    having talked with me for a short time, he went into the Imperial presence
	    and received the Imperial command. I am told that on that occasion the
	    Emperor gave him the foregoing advice. He, after having retired from the
	    Imperial presence, again talked with me. He told me that he would go to the
	    Peers' Club after that on that day and would invite the War and Navy
	    Ministers. He intends to ask the War Minister to select a person who can
	    cooperate with the Navy and the Navy Minister, to choose a person who can
	    cooperate with the Army. He will wait till the selection is made and on the
	    next day or the day following will have the Foreign Minister join them for a
	    full discussion of national defense, diplomacy, cooperation between Army and
	    Navy and the &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06256.jpg" n="6,256" xml:id="pb.109"/&gt;
	    
	    relation between the Supreme Command and the Government. And only after they
	    come to an agreement in their views will he begin selecting the other
	    Cabinet Ministers. He said that he wished to have KOREMATSU as his secretary
	    and asked me to use my influence for that purpose. He left at 8:40.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.318"&gt;I was summoned by His Majesty and received in audience at
	    8:45. I reported on Prince KONOYE's policy in regard to the formation of the
	    cabinet. The Emperor seemed to be satisfied with it. I retired from the
	    Imperial presence at 9:10. I reached home at 9:30. I received a treatment
	    from Doctor WATANABE.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06257.jpg" n="6,257" xml:id="pb.110"/&gt;&lt;note place="margin-right" type="hand"&gt;&lt;p xml:id="p.147"&gt;Quote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/note&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.126"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    Emperor's request and was received in audience at 2:15. Was asked by the
	    Emperor whether an order (which had been secretly resorted by the Prince,
	    the Chief of the General Staff, for heavy artillery mobilization for the
	    purposes of the South China campaign) had been fully cleared with the
	    Government. I replied that I would ask the Chief Aide-de-Camp to inquire of
	    the War Minister regarding the liason on this matter, and if the liaison had
	    not been sufficient, I myself would ask the Premier.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.334"&gt;Left the Emperor then and at once got in touch with the
	    Chief Aide-de-Camp on that matter.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.335"&gt;Learned from the Aide-de-Camp that he had heard as follows
	    from the War Ministers At the Four Ministers' Conference on the 12th (which
	    the Finance Minister was specially invited to attend) the results of a
	    careful study were that since in any case any preparations at all would
	    require a month and a half, they had agreed to push preparations. It was
	    decided at a cabinet meeting that a further cabinet decision &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06260.jpg" n="6,260" xml:id="pb.113"/&gt; would be
	    required if actual operations were undertaken. After inquiring by phone as
	    to Foreign Minister ARITA's opinion and receiving the same sort of answer as
	    that from the War Minister, I reported in person to the Emperor to the above
	    effect at four o'clock, and the Emperor was pleased to hear my reply.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.336"&gt;At that time the Emperor said one thing and another about
	    the change in the government. He said that he still today had faith in the
	    YONAI Cabinet, and that though a change of Cabinet was inevitable in view of
	    domestic and foreign conditions, he wished to have his feelings conveyed to
	    YONAI. I said that I would arrange to have the Emperor's feelings conveyed
	    to YONAI at the prope&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.139"&gt;Prosecution's documents 4028D, 4028E, 4023F and 4029C,

	    near the center of the page. I believe it is the sixth paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.355"&gt;I was again received in audience this afternoon from 2:25
	    to 2:50. The Emperor stated that the War Minister had just secretly
	    recommended TOJO for War Minister and Tomoyuki YAMASHITA for
	    Inspector-General of the Air Force but that he thought the procedure was
	    wrong, for Prince KONOYE was still in the midst of forming a cabinet and had
	    not yet accepted &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06267.jpg" n="6,267" xml:id="pb.120"/&gt; TOJO for the post, and, as he thought that the action
	    was rather over hasty, he had asked the War Minister whether he did not
	    think the action as being out of order.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.356"&gt;Being impressed with the reasonableness of the Emperor's
	    opinion after I had left the palace and on the occasion of my talk with the
	    Chief Aide-de-Camp, after expressing my idea, I told him that I hoped for
	    liaison by the War Minister in order that the present instance might not set
	    a precedent.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.171"&gt;The Tribunal's attention is directed to those of the
	    accused who, according to their personnel records now in evidence, were
	    called to major positions in the Japanese Government at the time of the
	    change in the cabinet, or within a few months thereafter. They are as
	    follows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.160"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.172"&gt;Well, do you want to repeat them all unless they include
	    the accused?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.161"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.173"&gt;No, sir, only those of the accused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.162"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. LOGAN: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.174"&gt;If the Tribunal please, at the commencement of this phase,
	    counsel mentioned all these names, and he has repeated them at least once,
	    and I believe twice, since then during the phase. Now, I cannot see the
	    purpose of doing this continuously during &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06268.jpg" n="6,268" xml:id="pb.121"/&gt; this particular phase of the case. It seems
	    to me that it is rendering undue influence with reference to these
	    particular men at these particular times. He has already stated it. Let it
	    stand at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.163"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.175"&gt;Well, it is an advantage to have our minds readily and
	    correctly informed at vital stages. There is no undue influence in that. It
	    probably would be an advantage to have the names of the accused who were in
	    that cabinet repeated here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.164"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.176"&gt;If it please the Tribunal, there is no overlapping of the
	    recital of positions. The previous recital that I made had not included this
	    particular period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.165"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.177"&gt;Well, proceed, Mr. Tavenner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.166"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR.

	    Policy&lt;/hi&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.363"&gt;The world is now on the threshold of a stupendous historic
	    change. New political, economic and cultural orders are in the process of
	    creation on the basis of the growth and development of several groups of
	    nations. Japan is also faced by a great ordeal unparalleled in history. At
	    this juncture, &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06272.jpg" n="6,272" xml:id="pb.125"/&gt; if we are to carry out a national policy truly in consonance with the
	    lofty ideal on which our nation is founded, it is of the most urgent
	    necessity to effect a fundamental renovation of the government
	    administration along all lines, and to march forward toward the completion
	    of a national defence structure, by surmounting all difficulties. The
	    general principles of the basic national policy have been therefore
	    formulated as follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.364"&gt;1. Basic Policy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.365"&gt;The fundamental aim of Japan's national policy lies in the
	    establishment of world peace in accordance with the lofty ideal of &lt;hi rend="underlined"&gt;Hakko Ichiu&lt;/hi&gt; on which the Empire is founded. First
	    of all, it is directed toward the construction of a new order of Greater
	    East Asia built upon a firm solidarity of Japan, Manchoukuo and China with
	    this Empire as the center. We will therefore speedily secure for herself an
	    unshakable national structure such as conforms to the new world situation
	    and march forward toward the realization of the national policy by
	    mobilizing the total strength of the nation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.366"&gt;2. National Defense and Foreign Policy.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.367"&gt;In the light of the new external and &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06273.jpg" n="6,273" xml:id="pb.126"/&gt; internal
	    circumstances of the Empire, we will so amplify armaments as to ensure the
	    execution of national policy on the basis of a state structure for national
	    defense through manifestation of the nation's total strength.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.368"&gt;The fundamental aim of Japan's foreign policy at present
	    lies in the construction of a new order of Greater East Asia. Attention will
	    be focussed upon a successful settlement of the China Affair, while, by
	    taking a longrange view of the great world change, constructive and elastic
	    measures will be adopted in order to advance the national fortunes of the
	    Empire.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.369"&gt;3. Renovation of the Internal Structure.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.370"&gt;The urgent task concerning the country's internal
	    administration is to renovate all branches of the government in accordance
	    with the fundamental principle of the national polity, and to lay down a
	    firm foundation for a national defense state structure. For this purpose, we
	    will aim at the realization of the following items:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.371"&gt;i. In parallel with the renovation of the educational
	    system in full accord with the fundamental principle of the national polity,
	    we will establish national morality which attaches &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06274.jpg" n="6,274" xml:id="pb.127"/&gt; the first
	    importance to the idea of service to the state by rejecting all thoughts of
	    selfishness and material gains. And we will aim at the encouragement of
	    scientific spirit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.372"&gt;ii. We will strive for a coordinated unity of government by
	    setting up a new national political structure.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.373"&gt;(a) Organizing the nation anew on the basis of cooperation
	    between government and people, and of service to the state, every man
	    according to his occupation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.374"&gt;(b) Reform of the Diet system so as to conform to the new
	    national political structure.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.375"&gt;(c) Creation of a new government service system through
	    fundamental renovation of the administrative methods with a view to
	    effecting unity and expedition.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.376"&gt;iii. &lt;corr&gt;Establishment&lt;/corr&gt; of the foundation for a
	    national defense economy on the basis of autonomous construction of the
	    economics of Japan, Manchoukuo and China, with this Empire as the
	    center.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.377"&gt;(a) Establishment of Japan's economic self-sufficiency
	    policy, making Japan, Manchoukuo and China as a single unit, and embracing
	    the whole of Greater East Asia.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06275.jpg" n="6,275" xml:id="pb.128"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.378"&gt;(b) Execution of a planned economy through cooperation of
	    government and people; especially perfection of a unified control system
	    over production, distribution and consumption of vital commodities.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.379"&gt;(c) Establishment of a financial plan aimed at the
	    development of coordinated economic powers; also, strengthening of financial
	    control.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.380"&gt;(d) Renovation of the trade policy in line with the new
	    world situation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.381"&gt;(e) Establishment of the measures for self-supply of the
	    nation's daily necessities, especially staple food stuffs.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.382"&gt;(f) An epochal expansion of important industries,
	    especially nervy, chemical end machine industries.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.383"&gt;(g) An epochal development of science, and rationalization
	    of production.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.384"&gt;(h) Improvement and replenishment of transportation and
	    communication facilities in line with the new world situation.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.385"&gt;(i) Establishment of a land development plan aimed at the
	    development of the coordinated national strength of Japan, Manchoukuo and
	    China.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.386"&gt;4. Establishment of the Permanent &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06276.jpg" n="6,276" xml:id="pb.129"/&gt; policies for
	    the enhancement of the mental qualities and physical powers of the people
	    which constitutes the motive force for the execution of national policy, and
	    for the increase of population; and especially fundamental policies for the
	    stabilization end development of agriculture and agricultural
	    communities.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.387"&gt;5. A decisive measure will be taken to rectify the
	    inequality of sacrifices on the part of the people, attendant upon the
	    execution of the national policy. Welfare measures will be fully carried
	    out, end the living conditions of the people renovated, so as to ensure a
	    living standard truly befitting a stout-hearted and strong-bodied people
	    capable to survive ten years of trials and hardships and surmount the

TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.388"&gt;Telegraph, Berlin, 1 August 1940.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.389"&gt;The Japanese Ambassador, with whom I carried out current
	    business today, in the end brought the talk to the role that the new
	    Japanese cabinet would have to play in big politics. KURUSU declared from
	    the beginning that he had not yet received any instructions from his new
	    government; he was of the belief that they should not wait too long for the
	    definition of the general lines of the new Japanese foreign policy, For his,
	    KURUSU's, own &lt;unclear&gt;world&lt;/unclear&gt; two methods could be considered:
	    either he is to wait until his government gives him instructions, or he is
	    to take up a position in accordance with the outlook here so as to advise
	    his government, before it firmly fixes its position. In both cases a talk
	    with us is necessary whether it be with the Foreign Minister of the Reich or
	    with me.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.390"&gt;The Ambassador did not go into details but gave some of his
	    own observations which might correspond &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06279.jpg" n="6,279" xml:id="pb.132"/&gt; to his personal view of the situation. He
	    believed that Japanese politics must now be orientated by taking a long
	    view. Apparently KURUSU is not thinking of a speedy end to the war and
	    reckons at any rate on a state of tension which has to he estimated to last
	    for years in which the relations of Japan with Russia and the USA are
	    naturally most important. The Ambassador told me that he is conscious of the
	    fact that the Foreign Minister of the Reich had suggested repeatedly to
	    Japan agreement with Russia. Such an action as well as the Japanese attitude
	    towards USA should be harmonized with the German and also Italian
	    intentions. The Ambassador reminded of the fact that the Reichs Foreign
	    Minister, on the occasion of the visit of Minister SATO, had pictured the
	    German-Japanese friendship and cooperation as being very important.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.391"&gt;Nevertheless, he, KURUSU, did not know exactly how this
	    cooperation is pictured by us in detail, especially if and at what time we
	    wish to see the Japanese weight thrown on the scale of the present conflict.
	    If, for instance, Japan would push, on her part, towards a war and enter
	    into the war against America, while, on the other hand, Germany believed the
	    end of the war near, expecting a quick victory, Japan would, probably, be
	    acting contrary to German &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06280.jpg" n="6,280" xml:id="pb.133"/&gt; wishes. If, however, Japan would not intervene now,
	    the factor Japan, and, especially her fleet, in the triangle
	    Berlin-Rome-Tokyo would by all means have great potentialities in the
	    future.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.392"&gt;I had the feeling that KURUSU expects of the new course in
	    Tokyo a tendency towards intervention in the war but wished to hear from me,
	    that this /intervention/ would not be quite timely according to German
	    opinion.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.393"&gt;The Ambassador would certainly be grateful if he could
	    obtain a hint in the near future - either through the Reichs Foreign
	    Minister personally or through me - as to which advice he should give his
	    government. He is clear about the fact that this advice must fully lie
	    within the framework of the German-Japanese policy of friendship. He may not
	    be quite certain, however, whether we still regard the Japanese-Russian
	    rapprochement as equally important as hitherto and whether the new Japanese
	    Cabinet should follow its anti-Anglo-Saxon course with an accelerated or,
	    possibly, at first with a moderate speed.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.394"&gt;Fundamentally, I just accepted the statements of the
	    Ambassador and did not anticipate a reply, to be given to them. I opposed
	    his opinion &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06281.jpg" n="6,281" xml:id="pb.134"/&gt;
	    
	    that the war may still last a very long time and may be followed by a still
	    longer period of tension.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.395"&gt;To&lt;lb/&gt; The Reichs Foreign Minister&lt;lb/&gt; "Signed

	    with the Japanese Ambassador, I would like to add the following: KURUSU's

	    war and that Japan not be forgotten in the new apportionment of the
	    world.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.398"&gt;Hereby submitted to the German Foreign Minister. (Signed)

	    know, or can find out, but their failure to do either will not render the
	    document inadmissible nor deprive it of weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.208"&gt;How is it that &lt;ref target="exhibit-0545.xml"&gt;exhibit
	    545&lt;/ref&gt; bears an earlier date than &lt;ref target="exhibit-0544.xml"&gt;exhibit 544&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.192"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.209"&gt;The reference to the first paragraph of document 544 shows
	    that it relates to a conference that took place on the first day of August
	    which is the same date as the exhibit to which your Honor just referred. The
	    document in question, although not bearing a signature, shows the Foreign
	    Office file number of the German Government and the context of it shows
	    plainly the matter to which it is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06284.jpg" n="6,284" xml:id="pb.137"/&gt;&lt;fw place="margin-left" rend="vertical"&gt;Wolf &amp;amp; Yelden&lt;/fw&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.193"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.399"&gt;The specific point, however, with which KURUSU concerned
	    himself for the longest period of time at his present visit today, was not
	    Japan's relationship to Russia, America, or England, but the new order in
	    the so-called Great East Asia sphere, which Japan is aiming at. Ambassador
	    OTT also touches this subject in his telegraphic report, but KURUSU repeated
	    MATSUOKA's statements in greater detail, in the following way: Japan wants
	    to organize the East Asia sphere, including the South Seas, on a broad
	    basis. MATSUOKA mentioned to OTT that Japan wants to create in this area a
	    situation in which there would be no conquest, no oppression, and no
	    exploitation. Everybody should come to his rights there. Japan for her part
	    would adhere to these three basic principles, but would then expect that no
	    European or American country would violate these principles. The matter
	    concerns itself with ideals, which if correctly understood, lie in the
	    common interest. KURUSU named Japan, Manchukuo, and China as the core of the
	    Great East Axis sphere, for which he used the term East Asia 'Axis'.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.400"&gt;KURUSU went on to say that, though Minister SATO had
	    received the impression of an unchanged &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06285.jpg" n="6,285" xml:id="pb.138"/&gt; friendly German attitude toward Japan here,
	    he was not quite clear on the ways and means of enlarging upon this
	    friendship, and now would be the time to learn the German conception of
	    these Japanese plans for the East Asia sphere.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.401"&gt;The Ambassador went so far to say that MATSUOKA and KONOYE,
	    in order to adjust their foreign general policy and the corresponding
	    cabinet talks in Tokyo would first have to clearly see how we stand
	    regarding the above. KURUSU did not refer to the desinteressement on these
	    overseas problems, which we expressed to the Japanese in May of this year,
	    but it was clear - and he obviously spoke under orders from Tokyo - what he
	    was aiming at.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.402"&gt;According to the description by KURUSU, OTT did not allow
	    himself any more than I today to be drawn into this field of discussion.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.403"&gt;At the end, KURUSU expressed the hope, to be able to
	    discuss these far-reaching problems soon with the Reich Foreign
	    Minister.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.404"&gt;Herewith to the Reich Foreign Minister.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.210"&gt;I will now read prosecution document No. 1590 A and C, in
	    evidence as &lt;ref target="exhibit-0545.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 545&lt;/ref&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.405"&gt;AN OUTLINE OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN FOREIGN MINISTER
	    MATSUOKA AND &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06286.jpg" n="6,286" xml:id="pb.139"/&gt;
	    
	    GERMAN AMBASSADOR OTT&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.406"&gt;Foreign Minister MATSUOKA invited German Ambassador OTT and
	    they had a conversation between 5 and 6:40 PM on August 1, 1940, the gist of
	    which is as follows:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.407"&gt;MATSUOKA:'I informed you the other day that no talking
	    would be necessary between Japan and Germany, nor you and me. My feeling,
	    however, is just as you know, and as I mentioned it the other day, I am
	    neither pro-German nor pro-British, but so to speak, pro-Japanese. So that I
	    dare to oppose the fact of leaving our destiny to any foreign country or
	    foreigner. But I think that Fuehrer HITLER and Foreign Minister of the Reich
	    must know the fact as well as Your Excellency knows it, that I am one of the
	    proposers and originators of the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern pact. Later,
	    when the problem of the Japanese-German Military Alliance occurred, you saw
	    my attitude and I think it is unnecessary to explain neither my feeling nor
	    my standpoint for Germany and Italy repeatedly. As you may find out easily,
	    both the government and the people have inclined to strengthen the power of
	    the Axis, but it is not decided yet in the cabinet council. I cannot
	    persuade Premier KONOYE and other members of the cabinet, unless I know at
	    least the outline of Germany's intention or attitude to the thought I &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06287.jpg" n="6,287" xml:id="pb.140"/&gt; embrace
	    before it will be carried out. In other words, I am very anxious to know
	    what the German attitude is on my point of view, or I am sorry to say that I
	    can hardly carry it out.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.408"&gt;OTT: 'It may be natural but I want to know what Japan is
	    going to do. Without knowing it concretely, I think Berlin cannot answer
	    you.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.409"&gt;MATSUOKA: 'I hate, as you know, to use diplomatic or
	    suggestive terms and I may express my thought freely. Japan is intending to
	    establish a new order of Greater East Asia, as made already public by the
	    Japanese Government, in a circle of Japan, Manchoukuo and China including
	    the South Seas, and wishes the liberation and freedom of all nations and
	    races in the sphere, and thus is planning to increase their mutual and
	    common profit aiming at co-prosperity. Speaking in the other way, I oppose
	    subjugation and exploitation. I object to them even if made by Japan. Of
	    course, some Japanese may be planning to subjugate and exploit these
	    regions, but they are taught to do so by some Europeans and Americans, and
	    so, they are those influenced by America and Europe. I oppose absolutely
	    these means whether they might be done by Japanese or European and American
	    powers. I have determined to resist and dispute if Japan would dare &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06288.jpg" n="6,288" xml:id="pb.141"/&gt; to commit
	    such deeds. There are fairly many Japanese who have the same opinion as
	    mine, that is, to wish all the people to get mutual and common advantages
	    and to attain mutual prosperity. Japan does not refuse to have these regions
	    entered by Europeans and Americans, nor will expel them from the sphere. I
	    believe this very principle will bring immediately a large profit to
	    Americans and Europeans too. You may have some doubt in what I said,
	    surveying the present China Incident superficially, but if enough time is
	    given, Japan will realize surely this idea as well in China.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.410"&gt;'Now, as I believe, Japan can manage by herself in what
	    concerns China, and I didn't question Germany about it. But I would like to
	    know what attitude Germany will assume towards the aforecited Japanese ideal
	    or course on the South Seas? What will Germany want to gain in the South
	    Seas? And what does Germany want and what can it do as regards
	    Russo-Japanese relations? As for the American-Japanese relations, I always
	    think the future world civilization will belong to the Pacific civilization
	    in which, I believe, both Japan and America will play great roles, and so
	    the relation between both countries is an important matter affecting a
	    serious influence on tomorrow's human beings. I wish to know what Germany
	    &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06289.jpg" n="6,289" xml:id="pb.142"/&gt; wishes to
	    do toward what she can do and what she requests of America or Japan from
	    this overall viewpoint. But, excepting this for the present, as it is a too
	    large and too distant a problem I want to know what Germany wishes to do
	    towards America and what she can do for the sake of Japan in the present
	    situation in the relation between Japan and America which you well
	    know.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.411"&gt;OTT: 'It is quite natural of your opinion, but I want to
	    know, first of all, of your meaning of the bounds of the South Seas.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.412"&gt;MATSUOKA:'In my personal opinion, I include as far as Siam
	    for the present in the sphere, but it may be extended by and by in the
	    future according to any change of circumstances.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.413"&gt;OTT: 'This is my personal opinion too. As to the South
	    Seas, Germany has three big viewpoints. Germany is now in the war against
	    Great Britain, but there is a possibility of developing into a war against
	    whole British Empire (war of destroying the British Empire) in the future.
	    The South Seas, for Germany, must be seen from this point of view. This is
	    (1) Germany must consider what should be done for her, with the South Seas,
	    when the war develops to such conditions, (2) just what &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06290.jpg" n="6,290" xml:id="pb.143"/&gt; things and
	    how much should be necessary to be required, (3) after all, the problem
	    depends upon the German attitude of how to settle and how to keep her with
	    Japan and the South Seas. Looking from such a broad &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06291.jpg" n="6,291" xml:id="pb.144"/&gt; standpoint at
	    the war against Britain, the China Incident is simply an incident, isn't it?
	    And I think, too, apart from this worldwide confusion and movement, the
	    China Incident cannot be solved. Don't you think so?'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.414"&gt;MATSUOKA:'I think I can agree with the last part of your
	    personal opinions, and once sent a discourse of that fact to a magazine. At
	    present, as you know, most of our people regard the China Incident as one of
	    the most urgent matters to be settled. I, as Foreign Minister, cannot help
	    considering the opinion of our people. The China Incident forms a part of
	    the world-wide confusion indeed. However, it is the grave question for Japan
	    to dispose of.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.415"&gt;OTT: 'How does Japan intend to settle China?'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.416"&gt;MATSUOKA:'To knock CHIANG KAI-SHEK down completely is
	    intended.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.417"&gt;(The Ambassador seemed a little startled.)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.418"&gt;OTT:'It must be a means; but are there not any
	    possibilities of consulting with CHIANG? I think it is a wise means to
	    consult with him.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.419"&gt;MATSUOKA: 'I do not entirely refuse to confer with CHIANG,
	    but there is no other means than to knock him down because of the Japanese
	    characteristic &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06292.jpg" n="6,292" xml:id="pb.145"/&gt; viewpoint. I think, at present, he has to be subjugated thoroughly. Of
	    course, means of arms is not the only one. At any rate, however, I believe
	    that Japan, by her power alone, is able to settle the China Incident.'&lt;/q&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06293.jpg" n="6,293" xml:id="pb.146"/&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.211"&gt;I offer in evidence three documents for the purpose of

	    against British possessions in East Asia desired by the Army.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.423"&gt;2. A blow against the influential pro-British groups-viz
	    court and economic circles - which, impressed &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06294.jpg" n="6,294" xml:id="pb.147"/&gt; by the
	    energetic action, will be dissuaded from further pro-British activity.
	    OTT.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.214"&gt;The second is prosecution document 4029-E. It is a telegram

	    well as those shown in the next phase of this case, are related to demands
	    of the French government for allowance of Japanese forces to be sent for
	    operations against China, to pass through the Tonkin province and to
	    recognize the use of airfields in that province by the Japanese, and to
	    furnish facilities for transporting arms and ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.200"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.218"&gt;Admitted on the usual terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.201"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;CLERK OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.219"&gt;Prosecution's document -- That has been admitted, has it

	    Dept. to instruct me about the following:&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.430"&gt;The French Ambassador had today changed the previously
	    announced basic acceptance of the three &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06296.jpg" n="6,296" xml:id="pb.149"/&gt; Japanese demands regarding Indo-China to the
	    attitude that France wanted first a Japanese guarantee for renouncement of
	    all territorial claims and only then would she decide about the
	    considerations of the Japanese demands. The Foreign Minister had urgently
	    demanded the French Ambassador to advise his government to maintain their
	    previously announced basic agreement. The question of territorial guarantee
	    could be adjusted based on the demanded declaration by the Foreign Minister.
	    The Foreign Minister requests the German government to support the Japanese
	    demands by influencing the French government. (1 group garbled) Ministry
	    Director promised, but it was pointed out that with reference to legalistic
	    statements in Telegram No. 654 dated from August 12 that our influence on
	    French policy is limited.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.431"&gt;(Signed) OTT.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.227"&gt;I now offer in evidence prosecution document 4029-F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.208"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.228"&gt;Admitted on the usual terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.209"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;CLERK OF THE COURT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.229"&gt;Prosecution's document No. 4029-F will receive &lt;ref target="exhibit-0548.xml"&gt;exhibit No. 548&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, prosecution's &lt;ref target="exhibit-0548.xml"&gt;exhibit No.
	    548&lt;/ref&gt; was received in evidence.)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.210"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;MR. TAVENNER: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Reading)&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06297.jpg" n="6,297" xml:id="pb.150"/&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.432"&gt;Telegram&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.433"&gt;Tokyo 23 August 1940&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.434"&gt;1. The Government announces an extensive revirement of the
	    Foreign Service. Recalled are the Ambassador of the U.S., Ambassadors at
	    France, Turkey, Brazil and also nineteen ministers, among them
	    representatives in Hungary, Spain, Finland, Bulgaria, Rumania, Argentina,
	    Egypt, Canada, besides them five embassy councillors among them the
	    councillers from England and Russia and finally eleven Consul Generals,
	    among them the Consuls from New York, Chicago, San Francisco, London,
	    Hamburg, and Prague. The Foreign Minister declared to the press, that this
	    action had become necessary in order to secure the new foreign policy
	    introduced by him and to bring the Japanese Foreign Service into
	    coordination with the new Japanese conditions. For this reason it is also
	    necessary to replace most of the division heads of the Foreign Ministry with
	    new personalities. Publication of these changes will soon take place. The
	    whole press of today is governed by this radical and, in Japanese history,
	    unique revirement, which is called a 'coup d'Etat' in several papers. The
	    drastic action of the government evidently intends in the first place to
	    render harmless the exponents of pro-Anglo-Saxon courses. This is also &lt;pb facs="TR03.19460924.06298.jpg" n="6,298" xml:id="pb.151"/&gt; strongly
	    underlined by the press. Only a few of the recalled officials will be used
	    in other posts.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.435"&gt;2. With the aim of further preparation of suitable actions
	    for the adjustment of State affairs on an authoritarian model, the
	    government had formed a commission of 24 leading personalities. Ambassador
	    SHIRATORI was appointed the representative for foreign political matters in
	    the &lt;corr&gt;commission.&lt;/corr&gt; The commission consists mostly of followers of
	    the reform movement and of the policy of cooperation with the Axis powers
	    which is constantly demanded by this movement.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.436"&gt;3. Both the diplomatic adjustment and the composition of
	    the commission, show again the efforts of the government to follow a new
	    course.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.437"&gt;OTT.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;q xml:id="sp.q.438"&gt;I will now read from prosecution document 2137-D, in
	    evidence as 541. Beginning on page 7: --&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;sp xml:id="sp.211"&gt;&lt;speaker&gt;THE PRESIDENT: &lt;/speaker&gt;&lt;p xml:id="sp.p.230"&gt;That is a lengthy document, Mr. Tavenner, so we will
	    adjourn now until half past nine tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/sp&gt;&lt;stage&gt;(Whereupon, at 1556 an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, 25 September 1946 at 0930).&lt;/stage&gt;&lt;p xml:id="p.247"&gt;- - - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;back/&gt;&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/teiHeader&gt;</textarea>
