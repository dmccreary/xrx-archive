                            <MILESTONE N="75" UNIT="sentence"/> Our little county has sent off five
                            companies of volunteers, and two more are nearly organized. <MILESTONE N="76" UNIT="sentence"/>Old Montgomery has responded well to the
                            call of the Governor; the almost constant passage of troops along our
                            line of railroad, and the great anxiety we feel about the war,
                            particularly such of us as have sons and other relatives in the field,
                            keeps up a continual excitement. <MILESTONE N="77" UNIT="sentence"/>Troops are passing here almost every day; and I would speak of the
                            hospitality of the citizens of our little village in furnishing them
                            with provisions, but the good book says we must not let our left hand
                            know what our right hand does. <MILESTONE N="78" UNIT="sentence"/>I may
                            be permitted to say, that those who have come from other States to fight
                            for our institutions, our freedom and our liberty, have not been
                            permitted to pass us unnoticed and without having their wants attended
                            to. </P>
                        <P>
                            <MILESTONE N="79" UNIT="sentence"/> We have seen some of the finest
                            looking companies pass that it has ever been our privilege to behold,
                            whose professions of regard for the old mother State were so strong that
                            I am satisfied that they will sacrifice their all for her. </P>
                        <P>
                            <MILESTONE N="80" UNIT="sentence"/> As most of your correspondents
                            confine themselves almost exclusively to the war news. <MILESTONE N="81" UNIT="sentence"/>I shall, in this brief note, depart somewhat from
                            the usual custom and make some suggestions about the future. <MILESTONE N="82" UNIT="sentence"/>I do this upon the presumption of our
                            ultimate success, of which I have never entertained a doubt. <MILESTONE N="83" UNIT="sentence"/>The suggestion I propose is on the subject
                            of <ORGNAME N="Sabbath School" TYPE="school">Sabbath school</ORGNAME>
                            books. <MILESTONE N="84" UNIT="sentence"/>Heretofore we have been
                            supplied by the North, written about the good children of that locality.
                                <MILESTONE N="85" UNIT="sentence"/>I am at a loss to know what
                            becomes of them. <MILESTONE N="86" UNIT="sentence"/>I believe they never
                            survive over <MEASURE N="6years" TYPE="date">six years</MEASURE>. Are
                            there no good children in the South, and are there not persons there
                            that can write books about them, in order that our Sabbath schools
                            hereafter may be supplied from that quarter? <MILESTONE N="87" UNIT="sentence"/>I have thrown out this suggestion, hoping that the
                            subject may find a more able and successful advocate than myself.
                                <MILESTONE N="88" UNIT="sentence"/>My wish is to be cut loose from
                            the North altogether and set up for ourselves, and be entirely free and
                            independent. <MILESTONE N="89" UNIT="sentence"/>We may have at first to
                            suffer some privations, but they will have to do the same. <MILESTONE N="90" UNIT="sentence"/>We should, however, be willing to submit to
                            any inconvenience to accomplish this object. <MILESTONE N="91" UNIT="sentence"/>We are now convinced that they have the most deadly
                            hatred for us, and are endeavoring to exterminate us. There may be some
                            of them who have no such feelings, but they dare not give expression of
                            favor for us, for fear of the mob, which now reigns triumphant over law
                            and Constitution. </P>
                        <P>
                            <MILESTONE N="92" UNIT="sentence"/> I cannot close this brief
                            communication without expressing my high appreciation of the services
                            which have been rendered to our volunteers by our ladies, who have been
                            almost constantly employed for weeks in making uniforms and other
                            articles of clothing for them; and some of them have actually tendered
                            their services to the proper authorities as nurses, in case of a battle.

                                    and stated his case to the presiding judge. 'You drew your sword
                                    to avenge the affront,' said the magistrate; 'that was right;
                                    but you did not kill your enemy, and you know that an insult, if
                                    not avenged by the blood of the offender, must be avenged by the

                                    when the policeman ripped up his abdomen with his own hand, and
                                    died on the spot." </P>

                                    <MILESTONE N="270" UNIT="sentence"/> We went farther; we
                                    separated for the sake of peace. <MILESTONE N="271" UNIT="sentence"/>But even this was not allowed us. We were

                                    country. <MILESTONE N="275" UNIT="sentence"/>Death is infinitely
                                    preferable to the loss of these. <MILESTONE N="276" UNIT="sentence"/>He who would choose life at such a

                                    <MILESTONE N="277" UNIT="sentence"/> It is a happy evidence that
                                    our people appreciate the character of this war, and a good omen
                                    of their success that, in its commencement, they appeal to the
                                    God of their fathers and invoke His help. <MILESTONE N="278" UNIT="sentence"/>The spirit of religion and the spirit of

                            <MILESTONE N="683" UNIT="sentence"/> I have now been here exactly one
                            fortnight, yet in all that time I have not communicated with the <HI REND="italics">Dispatch.</HI> My excuse is a very good one put as it

                            at present.--You have had a pretty accurate detail of the operations of
                            the Howitzers from other sources, and it is not allowed to tell all we
                            know of military plans; though, by-the-by, that is little enough.
                                <MILESTONE N="684" UNIT="sentence"/>In the absence of knowledge, we
                            have a thousand rumors every day, and they generally turn out to be as
                            worthy of credit as rumors generally are, and not one bit more so.
                            Things at present seem to have a downward tendency; that is, every eye
                            is eagerly turned to the country below us. Brisk operations upon a small
                            scale are going on there. <MILESTONE N="685" UNIT="sentence"/>Day before

                            of La Mancha. I understand that a similar rencontre occurred yesterday,
                            in which two of the enemy were slain. <MILESTONE N="689" UNIT="sentence"/>The achievement of <PERSNAME>Capt. Werth</PERSNAME> was a very

                                <MILESTONE N="690" UNIT="sentence"/>Incidents like it must give the

                            their lives It can hardly be violating any rule to say that

                                <MILESTONE N="691" UNIT="sentence"/>I can only say that we are all

                            Great, the cold hearted, cold-blooded, cynical infidel and scoffer, who
                            believed neither in God, nor in the responsibility of man for the deeds
                            done in the body. <MILESTONE N="701" UNIT="sentence"/>It has always been
                            told of him as descriptive of a single dash of his inflexible character,
                            and the iron nature of his discipline. <MILESTONE N="702" UNIT="sentence"/>Yet even of him, his last biographer (I do not mean

                            utterly without foundation, so far as he could discover, after a most

                            <PERSNAME>Napoleon</PERSNAME> was a genuine Corsican, impetuous,

                            likely to be guilty of a cruelty which could be so entirely useless.

                            consisted in the enthusiastic affection of his troops, and one such deed

                            below the Halfway House, that a party of Yankees were plundering the

                            <MILESTONE N="740" UNIT="sentence"/> We were startled at this place
                            yesterday by the arrival of another of the same sort, being a soldier
                            belonging to the <ORGNAME KEY="NY2" TYPE="regiment">New York Second

                            <MILESTONE N="742" UNIT="sentence"/> On being informed that some 15 or
                            20 Yankee soldiers were down below here on a farm, some one came riding
                            up, and asked who would volunteer to go after them, when several of the
                            North Carolinians, (that being the nearest camp to the enemy,)
                            accompanied by one piece of the Howitzers, immediately started and
                            captured said New York soldier, the rest of his comrades being too fleet
                            of foot to be captured. <MILESTONE N="743" UNIT="sentence"/>The
                            Howitzers fired their piece to the crowd, and would have killed every
                            one but, unfortunately, the shell did not explode. <MILESTONE N="744" UNIT="sentence"/>The prisoner bears a tolerable good countenance,
                            and seems to be an Irishman. <MILESTONE N="745" UNIT="sentence"/>By
                            sundown yesterday we had two more of them — total, three. </P>

                            with foam — and told the Colonel to draw up his men in line of battle,
                            that the enemy were advancing, he having seen an advance guard of 300
                            men ! The bugle sounded us to arms, and in about <MEASURE N="10minutes" TYPE="date">ten minutes</MEASURE> all the companies stationed here
                            were ready and anxious for the fight. <MILESTONE N="747" UNIT="sentence"/>We were marched up towards <PLACENAME KEY="tgn,7013687" REG="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia">Hampton</PLACENAME> a few yards,

                            hour, awaiting the approach of the enemy; but no enemy came, the alarm
                            having been caused by one of our scouting party meeting another of ours
                            — not knowing we had out two. </P>
