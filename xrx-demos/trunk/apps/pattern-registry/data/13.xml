    <Question>How can you connect an application to the messaging system so that it can send and
receive messages?</Question>
    <Answer>Use a Channel Adapter that can access the application's API or data and publish messages on a channel based on this data, and that likewise can receive messages and invoke functionality inside the application.</Answer>
    <NoteText>The adapter acts as a messaging client to the messaging system and invokes applications functions via an application-supplied interface. This way, any application can connect to the messaging system and be integrated with other applications as long as it has a proper Channel Adapter.</NoteText>
