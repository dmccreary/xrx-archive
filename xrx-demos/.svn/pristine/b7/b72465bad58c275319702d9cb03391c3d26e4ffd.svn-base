        <Excerpt_Description>By direction of Captain Craven I send up herewith two colored men whom I picked up off Maryland Point while cruising yesterday morning. The account they gave of themselves seemed of so much importance, if their statement can be relied upon, that I sent them first down to him off Point Lookout by the Reliance, as he could more readily from them ascertain the truth, and they were brought back today with the orders above mentioned.</Excerpt_Description>
