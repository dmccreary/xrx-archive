    <Excerpt_Description>I have the honor to inform you that two of the crew of this ship deserted from her yesterday morning in the city of Paramaribo, but as important interests require that I should proceed to sea, I will not await further the result of the search which the authorities have set on foot for them. May I request that these men, when arrested, may be detained in custody until I can come or send for them. The negro is not only bound to service on board this ship but is also valuable private property, and if he come to the hands of the Government will be reclaimable on this latter ground, as well as the former, by the Government of the Confederate States.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I have the honor to report the capture of the ship Nightingale, of Boston, under American colors, and with a cargo of 961 slaves. The ship will sail as soon as practicable, under the command of Lieutenant J. J. Guthrie, for New York, via Monrovia, Liberia. Herewith are enclosed a copy of the orders of Lieutenant Guthrie and his report of inventory. For the details of the capture, I beg leave to refer to the enclosed copy of my letter to the judge of the U. S. district court.  I have given all the needed directions to Lieutenant Guthrie about properly and amply providing for these unfortunate captives and enabling them to have as much pure air as possible, and finally to adopt every measure for their health and comfort. I also enclose a muster roll of the officers and crew of this ship at the time of the capture.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>There is another point of great interest also; I mean the slave trade connected with this island. There have been upward of 10,000 Africans imported within the last few months, and one cargo was landed within a short distance of this port. Both the north and south shores of the island require attention to intercept this nefarious traffic, therefore you may readily see that it requires more vessels than you have assigned to my command to perform those duties embraced in my instructions.</Excerpt_Description>

It has not been the policy of the Government to encourage the emigration of this class of persons, whether bond or free; but where you have them, as in this case, on board, you can, as I understand verbally you do, employ the slaves, and those who are free need not be returned.</Excerpt_Description>

When I landed there was a party of secessionists from Maryland in the house; they made their escape into the woods. I chased them for a mile, but they got off. I took ten contrabands who belonged to the person (Colonel Brown) owning the premises. Colonel Brown has been the receiver and forwarder of supplies and recruits, and of course his property used for that purpose is confiscated. As the schooner Dana is entirely out of provisions, and I have none to supply her, I send her up with the co trabands.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>On the night of the 9th, while this vessel was at anchor under Piney Point, a boat was seen pulling about and acting in a suspicions manner. Upon being hailed it came alongside. The crew was composed of four negroes, who represented themselves as having belonged to a Colonel Forbes, and that he lived on Machodoc River, Virginia. They stated that they had run away from their master because he intended to use them for military purposes, or, to use their own word, because he wanted to send them to the wars. I detained them subject to your action.  In obedience to your order they have been sent to the Resolute for transportation to Washington.</Excerpt_Description>

These servants, Roxy and Isaac, were taken to Fortress Monroe and there landed.  It is my earnest request that they should be returned to me, as they have not been employed for any military purpose against the Government of the United States.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Notes>The report isn't very detailed, but apparently two black men were attempting to run the blockade with four women and two children. It does not say whether or not they were freed men or slaves, or whether the women and children were also colored and/or slaves--if they were all colored, were they trying to reach freedom?</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>The subject of contraband negroes is one that is looked to by the citizens of Kentucky of vital importance. Ten have come into my camp within as many hours, and from what they say there will be a general stampede of slaves from the other side of Green River. . .They state the reasons of their running away their masters are rank secessionists, in some cases are in the rebel army, and that slaves of Union men are pressed into service to drive teams, &amp;c.. . . I have put the negroes to work. They will be handy with teams and generally useful.  The negroes that came to me today state that their masters had notified them to be ready to go South with them on Monday morning, and they left Sunday night.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Two gentlemen undefined to me, but introduced by Mr. Guthrie, say some negro slaves have taken refuge in your camp and are there sheltered.  The laws of the United States and of Kentucky, all of which are binding on us, compel us to surrender a runaway negro on application of negros owner or agent. I believe you have not been instrumental in this, but my orders are that all negroes shall be delivered up on claim of the owner or agent. Better keep the negroes out of your camp altogether, unless you brought them along with the regiment.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I would be much gratified if you would tell me what I am to do with the negro slaves that are almost daily arriving at this post from the interior. Am I to find food and shelter for the women and children, who can do nothing for themselves? Thus far we have been able to employ in various ways most of the adults. It appears to me some positive instructions should be given in regard to what shall be done for the number that will be accumulated in and about this post during the approaching winter. I hope you will give me instructions on this very important subject. Humanity requires that they should be taken care of.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>The much longer detention of the slaves, which has delayed the thrashing of the wheat crop, has engendered some little feeling of discontent among some of our people, who begin to question the legal authority of the proceeding; nor has this disquietude been allayed by the fact that many of the slaves, have returned to their masters, which has been followed by a hope to recover the fugitives [sic].</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Some wealthy men of Lancaster County, and a Mr. Underwood, of Surry, have refused to send their slaves, on requisition signed by myself, to work on the fortifications. . .If these gentlemen are sustained in their refusal, no negroes can be had when wanted. The laws of Virginia do not specify negroes, but it is a necessity of war. If sustained, I will carry out my plans. I have already the sanction in writing of the Secretary of War to this course, but will use the free negroes as far as possible.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I have no instructions from Government on the subject of negroes. My opinion is that the laws of the State of Kentucky are in full force, and that negroes must be surrendered on application of their masters or agents or delivered over to the sheriff of the county. We have nothing to do with them at all, and you should not let them take refuge in camp. It forms a source of misrepresentation, by which Union men are estranged from our cause. I know it is almost impossible for you to ascertain in any case the owner of the negro. But so it is; his word is not taken in evidence, and you will send them away.</Excerpt_Description>

This boy was sent out from the enemy's camp about 12 m. to-day with the dinner of his master (Lieu- tenant Allen), then on picket guard, but, mistaking his road, fell into the hands of our scouts. . .What shall I do with the contraband?</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>The number of citizens who are applying for permission to pass through the camps to look for their fugitive slaves proves the neces- sity of the order and its faithful observance. Such permits cannot be granted; therefore the great necessity of keeping out fugitives. Such slaves as were within the lines at the time of the capture of Fort Don- elson and such as have been used by the enemy in building the fortifi- cations, or in any way hostile to the Government, will not be released or permitted to return to their masters, but will be employed in the quartermaster's department, for the benefit of Government.  All officers and companies now keeping slaves so captured will immediately report them to the district quartermaster.</Excerpt_Description>

I learn from Colonel Perczel that there are many of this class flow in camp who have flocked there through fear. Some discretion will have to be used in forcing these people out of camp now that they are in. I would require all, however, who have masters in camp to take their negroes with them.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Until within eight days the work upon this fort, which was executed by several hundred negroes, was confined to the erection of three large traverses on the east half of the sea front, and the enlargement of another that I built upon the same face near the south angle. These traverses were of a size sufficient to contain a temporary bomb-proof shelter, and really served only to screen from our enfilading fire only three guns on the face, and also to cover the south half of the officers quarters.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>There were a group of hundreds of negroes building a fort for the troops of the State of South Carolina. The negroes were most likely forced into this arrangement, because there is no talk of any deal that they have.</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>A large force of negroes has been at work upon it during the last week. A large quantity of timber has been hauled into it, apparently for shell-proof shelters as well as platforms; most of the timber was too large for platforms. This battery seems to be for mortars, as no embrasures are yet made.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>No unusual movements are observed, except the firing of one gun in the city at about 14 oclock last night. A negro boy, escaping from the city, came down last night about 11 oclock in a canoe to this fort. He was at once sent back. The guard-ship anchored inside the main ship bar has, I observed, housed her topmasts.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I beg leave to assure you that I had no desire to discuss the question of right or of courtesy in reference to the treatment my officers received in the failure to return the hired boy, and my remarks were intended to apply to the professed owner of the boy, who, neglecting his duty as owner or master for months, had permitted the boy to hire himself out, every one supposing him to be free, and now, at a time when the exercise of his undoubted right puts gentlemen here to a serious inconvenience, for the first time asserts his rights of ownership. His excellency mentions in his letter to me, received yesterday, that the boy is a slave, and, of course, that ends the matter.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>On the morning of the 12th instant four negroes (runaways) came to the fort, entertaining the idea that we were placed here to protect them and grant them their freedom. I did what I could to teach them the contrary. In the afternoon I took them to Pensacola and delivered them to the city marshal, to be returned to their owners.. That same night four more made their appearance. They were also turned over to the authorities next morning.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Early the next morning one of our sentries brought a runaway negro, who reported that the enemy had abandoned their camp during the night, crossed the Gauley, and destroyed their boats. I ordered Colonel Ewing with his troops to verify the truth of the statement, which he soon did, returning with a stand of colors. Having taken possession of the camp and a few sick prisoners, I proceeded to the extremity of the camp, and saw that the ferry was gone, foot-bridge destroyed, and the enemys column out of sight, with the exception of a few wagons.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>At daylight on the 11th a fugitive slave from the enemy's intrenchments reported the flight of the rebels, when the general commanding directed me to verify the report. I entered the intrenchments with one of my companies, finding them deserted save a few stragglers, whom I sent to the rear. I placed a guard over the abandoned property, took down the flag of the enemy and placed ours in its stead, and reported to the general commanding.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Some contrabands now in my camp passed fifteen or sixteen loads of sick on the road to-day. Another contraband is in from Centreville, who tells me that the enemy in and around Manassas retreated to Gordonsville. This was talked of all over the rebel camp. The portion of the army immediately on the Potomac left to take post at Fredericksburg. This I learn from some contrabands and white people from the former every hour in the day.</Excerpt_Description>

I can perceive no diminution of Stones force. He has at least 1,700 men on post every moment from Point of Rocks to Edwards Ferry, or 5,100 on sentry duty. Colonel Radford thinks this a low estimate; I have never in my life seen such a chain of sentinels.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Your two communications are received, inclosing COPS of order on the slave question. I have no remarks to make on their status or future. My business here is to put down rebellion and exterminate guerrillas, and I cannot be troubled at present with any business with negroes further than to use them when the exigencies of the service require it</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Captain Kauffman appears to have asked Colonel Livingston about slaves, maybe in the area or just in general, or perhaps if his army comes across any. Livingston doesn't seem to deem it important compared to their other business and tells him he can't be troubled with it</Notes>

Any persons who shall interfere with or attempt to discourage the enlistment of negroes will be reported, together with a full state- ment of the facts and names of witnesses, to these headquarters, in order that they may be brought before a military commission or general court-martial on the charge of discouraging enlistments.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I am informed that a band of armed negroes are committing outrages at or near the Hermitage Landing, across the river, and some of the people ask protection.

Some of them are no doubt honest.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Seventh. The enlistment of negroes will receive especial attention. The orders on the subject will indicate the policy of the Government, but it will require that in order to have them fully carried into effect the duty should be placed in the hands of an efficient officer, with good men to assist him. The best place for idle, dissolute negroes is in the army, and such exertions as may be necessary to put them there that are not inconsistent with the orders of the War Department will be made. The number of negroes enlisted will be the best evidence of the fitness of the officer for the position of enlist- ing officer.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Missouri, for the coming year; needs all the slave and other labor she has within her own border. Humanity, as well as justice, forbids sending away to other States our helpless slaves. Moreover, bad men have been engaged in stealing and carrying negroes out of the State, and selling even those who were free. The exportation of negroes from Missouri is therefore prohibited. Nevertheless, the interests of the service demand that all able-bodied slaves fit for military duty in this department be received to fill up the quotas of the various districts required by the draft. Every one is therefore interested in having them promply enlisted.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>This order recognizes the need for labor in Missouri, and acknowledges that black and/or former slave labor will be required. Even though blacks will be used to fight for the Union, they are not allowed to be exported out of the state, because their labor is needed there. </Notes>

If so, it can be done.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Guitar seems to be at conflict with the actions of his superior officer, Lt.-Colonel Jacobson, who seems to be forcibly impressing negroes into the army and dealing otherwise with their families. Guitar will, however, enlist all able-bodied blacks that he can, and seems to believe that freeing all the slaves is not in the best interest of Missouri</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>I may state in general terms that I gave no instructions whatever to assistant provost-marshals on my recent tour of inspection. I need not say, therefore, that I did not instruct them to send detachments into peoples kitchens for recruits, nor to send their guards to bring away the families of discharged negroes by force and turn them over to the custody of the negro, although the latter may be their plain duty under some circumstances. Nearly every assistant pro- vost-marshal read the order under which I visited them, and hence they well knew, and now know, that I was there for other purposes than to instruct them. I venture to say that not one of them has acted upon anything which they claim I have said as instructions, showing fully that they do not regard themselves as having received any instructions from me. It was chiefly my business to find out how the recruiting of colored men could be pushed more actively and vigorously, and my conversation with the provost-marshals was very free and general.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>This is Jacobson's reaction to Guitar's report. He refutes Guitar's report that he was instructing forcible actions, and that he was merely investigating more active ways to recruit "colored men."</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>A black man named Sam Marshall had gone into town to get his children, who had been promised free to him. He was then arrested by a Union captain, and then tied to a tree and whipped viciously by about a dozen soldiers. "Sam is a quiet, well-behaved negro." Curtis doesn't blame Rosecrans for this event, but feels that Rosecrans needs to "correct such outrages," and prevent further such cruelty</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>As soon as the weather becomes warm they may be ordered away from the posts and towns, and when distributed about the country will be able to make a subsistence by their labor, which is much needed. Some of them may be sent to the western border, where they can join their friends who have escaped into Kansas, and by these means and by discouraging them from gathering about the villages and military posts, the evil will in a measure correct itself. it would be a blessing to the country to remove the negro families to Saint Louis, as requested by General Pile, but it would be a serious evil to the city, and would tend to the demoralization, disease, and death of the negro.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>The blacks in the area will either be recruited into labor or allowed to cross the border into freedom. They shouldn't stay in the city, apparently, or it will mean danger and even "death" for them</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>here are some negro women here belonging to a widow lady by the name of Harrison; their husbands enlisted some time since, and the mistress threatened to hire them out to different men to work out of doors, which they had never been in the habit of doin~. Finding they were to be separated and made to work in the fiel they ran off and sought refuge here. The son of the mistress caine the next day for the team they had taken, and told the negroes they need never come back any more; that their mistress did not want them. The negroes consist of an old woman, her two daughters, one having two children. What should be done with them?  I am informed that there are many cases where [when] the negro men enlist their wives are made to do the work formerly done by the men...Such cases seem unjust, yet I dont know what course to pursue, therefore I respectfully submit the facts to you.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Rice seems to be concerned with black women left behind when their husbands enlist in the army. Often, they are left doing their husbands' labor. </Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>In reference to the third point of inquiry, the commanding gen- eral instructs me to say that the cotton office has no power to exempt slaves from impressment for the use of private individuals. Where they require for their own use any large number of slaves for serv- ice in their operations they should apply to the labor bureau. In their general authority to impress it may become necessary for them to impress negroes, in which event they will be directed to notify the labor bureau the number impressed, the names of their owners, and the counties where they, reside. In carrying out the policy which the cotton office may wish to adopt, should it be deemed ad- visable by them to exempt the slaves of planters whilst transporting cotton under authority from that office and for which the Govern- ment is to be benefited, they will be instructed to consult with you before adopting and carrying out their policy, in order that there may be no collision or interfereiice with the labor bureau.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I men-tioned on yesterday that I supposed negroes could be had with the consent of their owners. The Government will pay the monthly hire, and assume all the responsibility which the laws of the State entail on hirers of slaves. If we cannot obtain the consent of owners, better do without the negroes. Otherwise, as you observe, there will be a general stampede, and we will be held to be the cause of it. Along the banks of the Mississippi negroes are worthless as prop- erty, and I suppose their nominal owners would be glad to place them in Government service, if the necessary means to remove the negroes could be secured.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Apparently, in Mississippi "negroes are worthless as property," so they will be able to be hired out to the Government (of the CSA).</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Information has reached me of the desire of many of the negro troops to desert. They are restrained by a belief that we will shoot or hang all who may fall into our hands. The cavalry in the rear of Port Hudson lately shot a number who had deserted from that place. This of course stopped further desertions. Our policy is to treat these negroes kindly, and rather encourage them to come to us than frighten them by harshness. The importance of this matter should be impressed on officers commanding outposts.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>The Confederacy not only has black troops, but also seeks to prevent them from deserting. Therefore, Gen. Walker is urging other commanding officers to "treat these negroes kindly" so that they'll stay in their ranks</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Information has reached here that the negro troops of the enemy are disaffected and are deterred from desertion by the fear of falling into our hands. In view of this fact, a wise policy dictates that such as fall into our hands either as deserters or prisoners, even With arms in their hands, be treated with all proper leniency. You will enjoin this upon your subordinate officers, especially upon those commanding outposts. All negroes coming into your possession will be sent to these headquarters as directed in paragraph 3.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Elgee has realized that any of Sherman's black troops that had been in the mood for desertion have decided agaisnt it in fear of falling into Confederate hands and, ultiamtely, slavery.

        <Excerpt_Description>Although there are many of these robbers in the parish, this is the first time they have ever gone about publicly in daylight robbing the citizens. These lawless bands are daily in- creasing in numbers; not only are they collecting the discontented whites and free negroes, but the slaves, already demoralized by the Yankees, are going to them every day, and my word for it, unless some protection is afforded by the military authorities, all the good, loyal, and honest men in~the western part of the parish will have to flee from their homes and abandon the country.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>There are robbers in the parish that are not only rounding up "discontented whites and negroes," but also taking and forcibly freeing slaves, who are also in turn going to them. Monell sees a catastrophe in the making if the slaves are not protected from leaving the plantations. If the white men have no slaves left, they will have to "flee from their homes and abandon the country."</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 19th instant, inquiring what has been the effect of the removal of negroes from Sedalia. This would have been answered promptly but for my absence at Jefferson City as witness before general court-martial. The effect of this removal has been beneficial both to the negro and the citizens. With few exceptions, women and children and men were sent off who were without any visible means of support, or what was needful to thin out the great excess of this vagrant population. Those who were left (and they were many), for fear they would likewise be sent off, diligently sought out employment and went industriously to work. There has been very little vagrancy here since, and I think those now here are behaving well and providing for themselves.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>There seems to have been a procedure to remove the blacks from Sedalia, and despite some bumps in the road, it was a success. Those who were left behind have sought out employment and gone to work</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>There is but one general officer left at Saluria, General Roberts, a man well advanced in years. There is great disaffection among the negro troops. The free negroes of the North and the escaped slaves do not harmonize, and it there was the least chance of deliverance, the slaves would undoubtedly embrace the opportunity to return to their masters.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Upton is of the opinion that in regards to the negro troops in the area (likely the same ones mentioned in the above letter), there is "great disaffection" and that the escaped slaves in the army and with free Northern blacks are not mixing well; he believes the former slaves are so unhappy that they would even want to return to their slave masters</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Did you telegraph Lientenant-Colonel Draper of the outrage at Allen? The negroes crowding into Macon must go to work on the farms where their labor is so much needed. We cannot permit them to remain in idleness and crime. We must not return them to masters nor encourage them to leave their homes, but we must insist upon industry, sobriety, and virtue; let them understand that work they must.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>A good deal of blacks are crowding around Macon and remaining idle. Fisk does not want them to return to their slave masters, but he believes that they must be put to work so they do not "remain in idleness and crime."</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>The cases have been submitted to headquarters Department of the Missouri, for decision as to whether they will be allowed to proceed. The military authorities are forbidden to return fugitives to their masters, and they are not permitted to leave the State of Missouri, for the simple reason that Missouri needs all the labor- ers that she has. It certainly, then, is unjust to allow men who have employed these fugitives from service and labor to be prosecuted for violation of law and recovery of damages.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Regarding the case of the two former slaves of Hickman (mentioned further above). Clarke says to the Circuit Attorney that the military authorities cannot return slaves to their masters, but they are not able to leave the state either, for their labor is much needed</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Thousands of citizens, quartermasters, and other Government agents have employed these fugitives from slavery and paid them their wages. All who have thus employed these fugitives from slavery are liable to prosecution both criminally and civilly under the statutes of Missouri. I have myself frequently compelled negroes to go out from my camps and garrisons and to go to work for farm- ers and others for wages. The Articles of War prohibit me from re- turning them to their owners. My own judgment and the best inter- ests of the country, of the service, and the negroes themselves led me to remove them from idleness and crime to indnstry.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Following the same tone as some previous reports, Fisk talks about the situation in Missouri, where the Federals cannot return fugitive slaves to their masters, but send them out to work so they do not remain in "idleness."</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>There is no doubt that a large majority of planters who have taken the oath, and who pretend to acquiesce in the proclamation setting slaves free, still cling to their slaves and to the hope that they will some time again hold them as slaves. I heartily believe that Rogers, who was elected to Congress from this State, is such a man.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>The practice of allowing negro women to wander about from one plantation to another and from one post or district to another, on Government transports, for no other purpose than to while away their time or visit their husbands serving in the ranks of the army, is not only objectionable in every point of view, both to the soldiers and to themselves, but is generally subversive of moral restraint, and must be discontinued at once. All negro women in future found wandering in this manner will be immediately arrested and compelled to work at some steady employment on the plantations.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Black women should no longer be allowed around military areas, or from one plantation to the other, because they are both being idle and distracting to the soldiers. From this point on, any black women "found wandering" will be arrested and forced into employment (but not slavery)</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>I am exceedingly happy to learn that you are so usefully employed in clearing Maryland of slavery. While I have none of the fanatical feeling on this subject of the old Northern abolitionists, I am satisfied that the institution has been a curse to Maryland and other border States, if not the cotton States, and that it is the primary cause of this war. By becoming free, Maryland will have taken a long stride toward future prosperity and great- ness.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>The raid entered town about 2 p. in., and left next morning, 19th July. During this occupation the negroes owned by citizens in the town and surrounding conntry broke into stores and carried off everything movable. There were no white persons present while this was going on, and conseqnently the negroes carry- ing off plunder could not be subsequently identified. I have since made every effort to recover stolen property, but so far with but little success.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>A Confederate captain has engaged a Union raid at Auburn, Alabama. While the raid was going on in town, the blacks seemed to have escaped their owners, plundered the town, and run off with everything they stole. Since there were apparently "no white persons present while this was going on," they were not able to be identified, and, I'm guessing, were able to escape</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>I hope anything I may have said or done will not be construed unfriendly to Mr. Lincoln of Stanton. That negro letter of mine I never designed for publication, but I am honest in my belief that it is not fair to our men to count negroes as equals. Canot we at this day drop theories, and be reasonable men? Let us capture negroes, of course, and use them to the best advantage...If Mr. Lin- coln or Stanton could walk through the camps of this army and hear the soldiers talk they would hear new ideas, I have had the question put to me often: "Is not a negro as good as a white man to stop a bullet?" Yes, and a sand-bag is better; but can a negro do our skirmishing and picket duty? Can they improvise roads, bridges, sorties, flank movements, &amp;c., like the white man? I say no.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>It has become generally known amongst the negroes throughout the district that their masters' consent is not necessary to their enlistment. They are flocking in by hundreds--far beyond the ability of the provost-marshal to attend to them--to enlist. This matter is one that has created considerable excitement in many districts. As yet I have no information of any violence, but it would not surprise me to learn at any moment that owners have banded to- gether to resist the enlistment of their slaves. As you will perceive from the inclosures I deferred an answer to that portion of Governor Bramlette's letter referring to this subject until your return.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Similar to the report above, it shows that in Kentucky, a divided state where slavery is still allowed, slaves are leaving their masters to enlist in the Union army. The masters' permission is not necessary for them to enlist, and so many slaves are escaping to enlist. Dickinson would not be surprised if the masters got together and found some way to resist this</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>It has repeatedly come to my knowledge, on the Mississippi, and recently Colonel Beckwith, my chief commissary, reported officially that his negro cattle drivers and gangs for unloading cars were stampeded and broken up by recruiting officers who actually used their authority to carry them off by a species of force. I had to stop it at once. I am receiving no negroes now, because their owners have driven them to Southwest Georgia. I believe that negroes better serve the Army as teamsters, pioneers, and servants, and have no objection to the surplus, if any, being enlisted as soldiers, but I must have labor and a large quantity of it. I confess I would prefer 300 negroes armed with spades and axes than 1,000 as soldiers. Still I repeat I have no objection to the enlistment of negroes if my working parties are not interfered with, and if they are interfered with I must put a summary stop to it. For Gods sake let the negro question develop itself slowly and naturally, and not by premature cultivation make it a weak element in our policy. I think I understand the negro as well as anybody, and profess as much conviction in the fact of his certain freedom as you or any one, but he, like all other of the genus homo, must pass through a proba- tionary state before he is qualified for utter and complete freedom. As soldiers it is still an open question, which I am perfectly willing should be fairly and honestly tested. Negroes are as scarce in North Georgia as in Ohio. All are at and below Macon and Columbus, Ga.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>This letter shows a consistent view exhibited by Sherman that blacks are more of use for labor than of soldiers. He still wants to delay focusing on the "negro question." He is showing, however, a bit more openness to black troops, but only after his labor requirements have been met. Blacks are scarce, however, because their owners have presumably picked up on Union activity and have "driven" them further southward</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Will you please have a squad of twenty-five or thirty mounted men sent to this place. I have applied to Colonel Eve, com- nianding Camp Burnside, without avail. It is necessary to have such a force here to enforce obedience to law. Citizens and deserters are banding together for the purpose of resisting the enlistment of negroes, stealing, and murdering Union men. Several have been killed in this section, many more threatened. If we had twenty-five mounted men here we could keep the scoundrels quiet. Please answer.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>This request shows the urgency of the situation in Kentucky. "Citizens and deserters" are resisting the enlistment of blacks in the army, to the point of murdering soldiers. Sawyers needs more men to keep the locals under control</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>You came into our country with your army avowedly for the purpose of subjugating free white men, women, and children, ad not only intend to rule over them, but you make negroes your allies and desire to place over us an inferior race, which we have raised from barbarism to its present position which is the highest ever attained by that race in any country in all time</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>General Hood is angrily writing a letter to Sherman, and in this part, he claims that "You," whether that is the Union or Sherman specifically, have aimed to subjugate all free whites and raise the blacks over them. This accusation is quite contrary to Sherman's particular views, as he tends to avoid the "negro question", as see in his other letters, and prefers them in labor than in other positions in society</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>The commencement of the recruiting of colored troops in Ken, tucky was signalized by disgraceful outrages perpetrated in the twin- and, it would seem, inseparable interests of treason and slavery. Slaves escaping from their masters with a view of entering the military serv- ice were waylaid, beaten, maimed, and often murdered. This shame- ful condition of things, however, has disappeared under an improved public sentiment and from the vigor and success with winch the Gov- ernment has continued to press its policy. The popular opinion is rapidly reaching the conclusion that the policy of recruiting colored troops is too firmly established to be resisted, and that it is the interest as it certainly is the duty, of Kentucky to acquiesce in it. The feeble opposition which still remains is fostered mainly by unscrupulous poli- ticians who hope to make out of this popular irritation a certain amount of political capital to be invested in the approaching Presidential election. Upon the whole, the recruiting of colored troops in Kentucky must be held to be a decided success thus far, and to be full of encourage- ment for the future.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I presume the large number of slaves lately recaptured by our troops from the marauding cavalry of the enemy are more burdensome than useful in Petersburg or with the army, and, besides, are difficult of reclamation by the owners, most of whom will, probably, be averse to visiting Petersburg at this time. On the other hand, the active laborers among them could be made very useful assistants in the repair of the Danville road, and all could be more readily supplied and placed within reach of their owners by being sent up on the line of the road. I therefore take the liberty of suggesting such disposition of all, but especially of the laborers, and to avoid delay, in case of your ap- proval, send over Lient. L. A. Dade, of the Engineer Corps, to arrange for their transport and to take charge of them.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>The Confederate army has recaptured many slaves in recent battles around Petersburg, and the CSA War Secretary is presuming that they are "burdensome." Their owners likely donât want to come near the battlefield to reclaim them. Seddon suggests using them for labor, and once the Danville road is repaired, that can be used to send them back to their owners</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>Recently a force of negro troops, with a squad of cavalry, were landed about eight miles above Westmoreland Court- House. They very soon separated into detachments of sufficient num- ber to pursue all the routes of travel down to the Neck, and occupying the roads they marched leisurely down, sweeping through the inter- mediate country and visiting almost every dwelling. They were evidently in search of no armed force, and expected to encounter none. Besides the enticing away of a large number of negroes, their immedi- ate, or at least ostensible, purpose seemed to be to collect the horses and mules, cattle and sheep...</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>There is a serious difficulty which does not appear to have been considered, that of the treatment of slaves who might desert from the enemy and claim to be entitled by promise to be sent to the border, &amp;c. Thus we could not entertain the proposition and should not be placed in the attitude of having made the promise.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>It is unclear exactly what is being talked about here, but the "enemy" is the Union; what "border" is being talked about is also unclear. It is possible that slaves that desert the Union might claim that they were promised to be "sent to the border," possibly to freedom?</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>The citizens of Kentucky, by a large majority, are loyal, and the Legislature eminently so; but with politicians there are many shades of difference, only known to themselves, and which I could not coin- prehend. They regard the institution as virtually dead, and feel that it would be of benefit to the State to be entirely rid of slavery; but the people, while progressing in the right direction, have not schooled themselves to believe that the time has arrived for decisive action on their part for the entire abolition of slavery.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Essentially, Kentucky is loyal to the Union, but the people of the state are not yet ready to accept total abolition of slavery</Notes>

The Secre- tary of War shall appoint a ~ommission in each of the slave States represented in Congress, charged to award to each loyal person to whom a colored volunteer may owe service a just compensation, not exceeding three hundred dollars, for each such colored volunteer, payable out of the fund derived from commutations; and every such colored volunteer, on being mustered into the service, shall be free.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>I heard a young lady in Canton, educated at Philadelphia, who was a communicant of a Christian church, thank her God that her negroes, who had attempted to escape into our lines at Big Black, had been overtaken by Ross Texas brigade and killed. She thanked God, and did so in religious sincerity. Now, a stranger to the sentiment of the South would consider this unnatural, but it is not only natural but universal. All the people of the South, old and young, rich and poor, educated and ignorant, unite in this, that they will kill as vipers the whites who attempt to free their slaves, and also the ungrateful slaves who attempt to change their character from slave to free.</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Sherman is recounting the story of a religious Southern woman who thanked God that her slaves, when they escaped and attempted to come into Union lines, were instead caught by Southerners, shot and killed. He remarks that this behavior is normal in the South, and that Southerners would also kill whites who attempt to free their slaves</Notes>

        <Excerpt_Description>The first step in the liberation of the negro from bondage will be to get him and family to a place of safety, then to afford him the means of providing for his family, for their instincts are very strong, then gradually use a proportion--greater and greater each year--as sailors and soldiers. There will be no great difficulty in our absorbing the four million of slaves in this great industrious country of ours, and being lost to their masters the cause of war is gone,</Excerpt_Description>
        <Notes>Sherman here differs a bit from his usual view--he believes normally that blacks are best as laborers.

        <Excerpt_Description>On Saturday, June 27, 1862, we left old mistress, and young miss, and every other kind of miss. The Rebels getting Page 36  too hot in old Winchester, we made for the old Keystone State, came to Greencastle, remained there a few weeks, left for Chambersburg, next for Carlisle, and then to Harrisburg. Father and mother, four brothers and two sisters came. I am told that when old mistress got up in the morning, found all the negroes gone, they thought that the devil had got into them negroes last night. Every one is gone, and where are they gone to? I suppose they have gone with them devilish Yankees. But here is what they said, if we would come back they would set us all free. I had heard that too often, so I did not listen to that kind of talk. I thought that they had had their time, and this was my time. So off we went, and if it had not been for Gen. Geary we would all have been taken down South, and never would have saw each other again. His army was there, and the orders were that no one could leave Winchester. My ather went to the General and told him all bout it, and he was so kind as to give us Page 37  a pass through to Pennsylvania. Two days after that the Rebels came for us, but we were all gone. </Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>Of course I liked Mr. Valsin well enough, but I rather be free than be with him, or be the slave of any body else. So his word about going to Texas rather sunk deep into me, because I was praying for the Yankees to come up our way just as soon as possible. I dreaded going to Texas, because I feared that I would never get free. The same thought was in the mind of every one of the slaves on our place. So two nights before we were to leave for Texas all the slaves on our place had a secret meeting at midnight, when we decided to leave to meet the Yankees. Sure enough, about one o'clock that night every one of us took through  Page 115   the woods to make for the Union line. The moon was shining like day. After we had traveled till about four o'clock in the morning, the way through the woods being rather rough, we took the public road next to the river. We suddenly came where the levee made a short and sudden bend. The water in the river was up to the bank, and on the other side was a very high fence. In that yard were several bad dogs. While here, all at once before us we heard about a dozen men on horseback. They came right on us, and cried out, 'Halt! halt!' Several jumped the fence and made for the woods, while the dogs almost devoured them; but twenty-five of us were captured by this band. We hoped that they were advanced guards of Union soldiers, but instead of that they proved to be 'Cadien patrollers watching out for runaways. I tell you, child, we were in a bad fix. We were all handcuffed, two by two, and a chain was passed between us linking all the handcuffs, and we were marched back to our master.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description>It was not long before it was reported that Bragg was marching on Louisville, and the first thing the people knew, the Federal forces were concentrating in and around the city. The McKnights were just within the Federal lines. Many military organizations were camped about their place, and Allen met quite a number of the men and officers. He stated to one officer his history of woe, and expressed a desire to be free. He was invited to become a member of the hospital corps of the Forty-fourth Illinois as a nurse. He accepted the invitation. So when the troops were ordered to the front, he went with them.</Excerpt_Description>

        <Excerpt_Description> While there was not a single slave on our plantation that could read a line, in some way we were kept informed of the progress of the war almost as accurately as the most intelligent person. The "grapevine" telegraph was in constant use. When Lee surrendered, all of the plantation people knew it, although all of them acted as if they were in ignorance of the fact that anything unusual had taken place.  Early one morning, just after the close of the war, word was sent around to the slave cabins that all the slaves must go to the "big house," the master's house; and in company with my mother and a large number of other slaves, including my sister Amanda and brother John, I went to the "big house," and stood by the Page 20   side of my mother, and listened to the reading of some papers and a little speech made by the man who read the papers. This was the first public address I had ever heard, and I need not add that it was the most effective one to which it had ever been my privilege to listen. After the reading of the paper, and the speech, my mother leaned over and whispered, "Now, my children, we are free." This act was hailed with joy by all the slaves, but it threw a tremendous responsibility upon my mother, as well as upon the other slaves. A large portion of the former slaves hired themselves to their owners, while others sought new employment; but, before the beginning of the new life, most of the ex-slaves left the plantation for a few days at least, so as to get the "hang" of the new life, and to be sure that they were free. My mother's husband, my stepfather, had in some way wandered into West Virginia during the war, and had secured employment in the salt furnace near Malden, in Kanawha county. Soon after freedom was declared he sought out my mother and sent a wagon to bring her and her children to West Virginia. After many days of slow, tiresome traveling over the mountains, during which we suffered much, we finally reached Malden, and my mother and her husband were united after a long enforced separation.</Excerpt_Description>
